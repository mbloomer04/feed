While some of these vaccines are already available but underused, others would need to be developed and brought to the market as soon as possible.
AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines, making people sicker and increasing the risk of illness, death and the spread of infections that are difficult to treat. AMR is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, yet, at the same time, many people around the world do not have access to essential antim…</span>

Based on these evaluations, WHO advises vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities on the implications for future updates to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The next decision-making meeting of the TAG-CO-VAC is scheduled for mid-December 2024, after which a statement on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition and an accompanying data annex will be published on the WHO website.
