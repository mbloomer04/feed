User-centred design enables us to deliver on that intent and our maturity model supports teams to develop their user-centred design capability.</span>

The NHS is available to all so it&#x27;s really crucial that the content on the NHS website must be available to all.


It is the UK’s biggest health website with more than 50 million visits every month and the NHS videos on the website and You Tube Channel  attracted over 28 million views in 2020.

NHS Digital design principles say: “Be inclusive: NHS services are for everyone. Make sure people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs can use your design.”


However, on the NHS website, skin symptoms are mostly described in terms of how they appear on white skin. There are very few examples of what skin problems and conditions look like on various skin tones.</span>

                              <span>Tero Väänänen, Head of Design at NHS Digital, talks about how important it is to design your organisation before you start designing services.


The demand for service designers has grown rapidly in recent years, while the understanding of what service design is, has not. For many organisations, service design is simply ‘user experience’ with a new name.


Service design, and user-centred design, are mutually supportive ways of working to approach problems, to achieve the best possible outcomes.


For effective service design, organisations must understand the conditions required and be prepared to make changes.</span>

As the Head of User Research, I often have conversations with people about what role user research plays in delivering great services. They can have very different levels of understanding of user research. Some really understand it, others have heard of it but don’t know what it is and some people have never  heard of it and make incorrect assumptions.</span>

Many GP surgeries across the country offer patients the ability to book their appointments in the NHS App. Online appointment booking enables patients to access primary care digitally, which eases pressure on GP surgery staff, who are facing the extreme clinical challenges of the coronavirus pandemic during the already difficult winter months.</span>

It was only when I came to NHS Digital that I was exposed to the concept of user-centred design.


One of the frequent challenges in my previous creative roles was explaining why we needed to bear in mind specific considerations for the audience that a commissioner had not always recognised.


Often, clients submitted a request for a video without a strategic purpose. We would rely on brand guidelines where they existed, but this still didn’t answer the central question of why we should create things a certain way. This all started to change when I began to learn the principles of user-centred design.</span>

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, free coronavirus tests were only for key workers so they could continue their critical work. But eligibility for tests would soon change as infection rates started to spike.


We were ready for the first surge, which came in October 2020. The government swiftly kickstarted the expansion of testing with rapid lateral flow tests. We wanted everyone to ‘Get a free NHS COVID-19 test’.</span>

Recently, my wife and I tested positive for COVID-19. My wife, being asthmatic, was concerned whether she had enough of her medication to last for the (then) 10-day isolation, and ordered a new repeat prescription using the NHS App.


Her nominated pharmacy let her know her medication was ready for collection, but when we explained we were self-isolating and unable to pick it up, they could not offer a delivery.</span>

As we developed the COVID-19 national booking service in Autumn 2020, we became aware that a question that asked users for their gender might be a barrier for some people wanting to book a vaccine.</span>

It is pretty obvious to say that design changes people’s lives. If it didn’t, we wouldn’t spend so much of our time trying to get it right.


But the reality beneath that unoriginal claim struck home for me recently as I worked on a report tool, part of the replacement system for national cervical screening.


It’s not the most dramatic or heart-rending example of our impact – but is perhaps no less meaningful for that. It’s a small piece of work that speaks to the everyday reality we try to grapple with as interaction designers in the NHS.</span>

“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.


“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.


“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.


“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.

One of the guiding principles of the ‘Register with a GP surgery’ service is to be accessible and inclusive to all. Though there is a shift towards digital to make registering with a GP surgery easier and more convenient for both patients and practice staff, we haven’t forgotten the importance of developing a paper registration form for those who prefer not to or can’t use a digital service.</span>

General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in our communities. GPs treat common medical conditions, refer patients to hospitals and act as the first place many go to for health and wellbeing advice. This is why it is so important that everyone can register with and see a GP when they need to.</span>

The reason is that the Developer hub was set up as a space where API consumers can learn about the NHS Digital onboarding journey and identify the APIs which they’d like to onboard with. It made sense to only represent our NHS Digital APIs in there and aimed to avoid confusion or dilute our onboarding journey for external suppliers and partners.</span>

Last year we published our blog ‘What happens when we ‘sunset’ our APIs?’ in which Munish Jokhani explained how we actively deprecate (where we advise of our intention to retire the API while retaining all existing service levels) and retire our APIs, and the effect this had on developers. By working with our suppliers and engaging them early in the process, we found that we were able to agree and align the retirement dates so that we met our suppliers’ requirements.</span>

In the decade since the NHS Spine was launched, digital health and care services have become significantly larger, much more complex and more central to NHS provision. The Spine platform provides critical healthcare infrastructure and we must modernise to keep up with the demands being placed on it.</span>

                              <span>Most prescriptions are still paper-based in secondary care. Business analyst Andy Harrison describes the technical groundwork we’ve laid to allow these settings to go digital.


The little green FP10 paper prescriptions have all but disappeared in primary care. 18 years ago, we launched the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) and it has since become an indispensable tool for primary care teams. Nearly all GP practices use it and about 95% of primary care prescriptions are now sent electronically. Last year, that amounted to 1 billion items dispensed using the service. It’s a safer, faster and more convenient way to prescribe.</span>

Cyber security is about risk reduction and that can make it a difficult sell in the NHS.


Hard-pressed boards often want to know how much something is going to save them, but the cost of not implementing cyber security measures can only be calculated when their network or system is compromised.</span>

We recently published an update to the roadmap for the NHS website (nhs.uk). This describes what we will (and won’t) do to meet user needs and organisational goals on the UK’s biggest health website.


Previously, the roadmap we used internally was more like a Gantt chart than a true roadmap. Each item had a start and an end date and a description of the output, not the outcome.


In March 2023, we made significant changes to how we created and presented the roadmap. This is how we did it.</span>

I spend part of my week in a hospital setting and part as a locum in community pharmacies. The Summary Care Record application (SCRa) has always been an indispensable tool in this work, allowing quick and secure access to clinical information, but it can be tricky to access when moving between sites for locum clinicians like me.


In December 2022, I was approached by the Summary Care Record application team at NHS England to test out the National Care Records Services (NCRS), the successor to the SCRa. This is some of what I have found out.</span>

It should be quick and simple for a patient to register with a GP surgery, but often it isn’t. Having worked in many GP surgeries, I’ve seen both patients and practice staff struggle with the process, leading to a poor experience for all. This can vary from patients being daunted when faced with dated, confusing and lengthy paper registration forms to busy practice staff having to find the time to deal with new registrations amongst all their other tasks.</span>
