                              <span>Hi, my dad has myeloma and a range of health issues as a result of his condition and treatment. He is currently in hospital with a severe infection, while also waiting for an operation.
 I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to get &#x27;involved&#x27; with his treatment. My Dad (and Mum) are lovely people but they don&#x27;t know how to navigate the NHS and struggle to understand basic medical terminology and advice. They are great parents, this just isn&#x27;t the kind of thing they&#x27;ve dealt with before. This has left me and my brother struggling to know what&#x27;s going on and we aren&#x27;t confident our parents are asking the right questions/ understanding and following advice. For example, my mum wasn&#x27;t sure if my dad had sepsis or meningitis after speaking to the doctor.
 Is there a process/ system in place that will allow me to be more involved? I&#x27;m hoping my dad can nominate me and I can be present in important appointments to understand more and translate for my parents. I&#x27;ve been lucky and haven&#x27;t had any health issues serious enough to know how the NHS works, but I&#x27;m confident I can help my parents (and I think they would agree).
 Thank you!

 Additionally, if the good folks here could give advice on how to prepare for appraisals. As well as the pros and cons of ditching your license.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been suffering from chronic symptoms since 2016 and saw many different doctors since then. I&#x27;m still undiagnosed. I&#x27;ve just heard about internal medicine and it sounds like the obvious thing for me to go to.
 But since none of the doctors I saw ever mentioned it, I&#x27;m wondering whether there is such a thing in the UK?
 After googling it I see many results about how to study internal medicine. But nothing about patients consulting internal medicine doctors. What the heck?

                              <span>My GP surgery takes 3 months minimum to do a private referral and sign forms for insurance. They take no more than a week for an NHS referral. I’m confused by this and frustrated. Is it not helpful to take the pressure off the NHS by going private? Is there a hidden incentive for NHS referrals? Why would you keep patients waiting so long when they need to go private because it’s urgent?

                              <span>I moved house around 4 months ago (from just outside London to inside London) and I have remained registered to my old GP. I was referred to an ENT clinic, and I am receiving treatment there and I have to go back very 2-3 months. It’s an hour and 30 mins away from my current address but I don’t mind this as I’m often in the area to visit family or friends. 
 I don’t want to register with a new GP in my new area because I am worried I will not longer be able to attend my current ENT clinic. I would prefer to stay at my current clinic because they offer Saturday appointments and also not sure what the deal is with waiting times in my new area. I guess I would be put back to the bottom of the list?
 I asked the ENT doctor if I could continue seeing him after changing my GP and he didn’t know.
 Is it at all possible for me to stay at this clinic after changing my GP?

                              <span>I&#x27;m honestly so confused right now. So basically I have epilepsy, and I&#x27;ve been told by people to not switch brands because it can cause extra side affects, which I&#x27;ve experienced (fuck you milpharm).I had seizures 4 days in a row which was not nice lmao)
 I&#x27;m on generic tablets(lamotrigine) right now, and I&#x27;ve been requesting a specific one for a little while which has worked, now I&#x27;m being told the one I had a reaction to is the only one in stock, and it&#x27;ll stay that way for a long while.
 Apparently generic tablets are only made at certain times during the year so once they&#x27;re out of stock they&#x27;re out of stock. WHY TF IS THAT A THING!! They said to tell my doctors to prescribe me Lamictal (the legit brand) because they make it all year round so it will always be in stock.
 If you cant get generic tablets all year round why even have it for sale in the first place, Its just going to make people suffer for no reason. I get they&#x27;re trying to save money but people are all going to end up going onto the name brands when they realize what&#x27;s happening. This isn&#x27;t America where it&#x27;ll change the price for us.
 Can anyone shed some light on this as I&#x27;m beyond lost.

 Is it appropriate for me to contact the clinic to ask if any have come up? How often would it be acceptable to do this as I don&#x27;t want to be a nuisance?

Has this happened to anyone else? I’m not sure if it has anything to do with the price increase and they’re recalculating the monthly payment?

                              <span>Longshot but seeking to get some advice. Essentially I am increasingly realising that medicine might not be for me sadly. I am quite interested in Management and business and hence thinking about doing an MBA…
 Has anyone went from being a doctor to doing an MBA? - How did you go about doing this? - How have you found it? - Did you continue with a career in medicine/ healthcare after? - Anyone knows any scolarships/ Cheaper MBa courses one can apply to that would consider/ give preference to Medicine degrees?
 Thanks a lot 🙏🙏

                              <span>I have passed both USMLE Step 1 and Step 2. Scored around 85% percentile in step 2. Should I move to the states for internal medicine and then cardio &gt; 600k minimum in around 6-7years. ?
 All that aside - my question is, is it even that important? Im a current F1 and ive made 60k this year pre-tax. I live a pretty good life. I actually want to do surgery but would give that up if i moved to the States. 
 Ive spoke to a friend of mine who is ST6 in surgical sub-speciality (not gensurg/neurosurgey type) and he says you can comfortable clear 6 figures in reg years by locuming - especially if NROC. Which then rises to around 200-220k as a consultant with NHS + PP. 
 My question is basically:
  
How important is money beyond 100-150k (my partner is also a doctor so x1.5-1.6 as she will go LTFT). 
 
Would any surgeons here give up surgery to make 3x the money in a procedural speciality in the states. 
 
I have all my family here - both parents are doctors and dad is 70% private in a high earning speciality clearing around 350. Add all that together and I am naturally very privileged and its great having family near by. Is it worth giving all the family support and all that comes with it for an extra couple 100 thousand a year. 
 
I also just a bought a house, I dont know if this would tie any of yous down but I dont think this is a limiting factor. 
 I understand this may come of like me being boastful but I genuinely am very confused. To be honest i struggle to sleep at night thinking about this decision. I sometimes wish I just flunked the steps so that this wouldn&#x27;t have to be a decision i needed to make.
 
 My current plan is to apply for: IM (US), CST (Uk) and Plastics (US) 
 For anyone familiar with the US, my stats are:
 Step 1: P (1st attempt)
 Step 2: 267
 Publications 10
 2 months of US Clinical Experience.
 Would really appreciate the advice of anyone - sorry if this came off in a bad way.

                              <span>I come to you today with a rather embarrassing issue that has been plaguing me during my shifts at the hospital. Every time I step into the elevator, without fail, I seem to release an audible flatulence that, to my dismay, sounds uncannily like the squeaky voice of Stuart Little. Not only is this situation mortifying, but it&#x27;s also becoming a topic of discussion among my colleagues.
 I&#x27;ve tried to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, considering dietary habits, stress levels, and even possible gastrointestinal issues, but to no avail. It&#x27;s as if the elevator itself triggers this bizarre auditory association.
 I turn to you, my esteemed peers, for any insights or advice you may have on how to address this peculiar predicament. Is there a medical explanation for such a specific auditory resemblance, or could there be a psychological aspect at play here? And most importantly, how can I prevent this from happening in the future?

                              <span>Attended a conference last month online as it wasn’t practical or affordable to fly halfway round the world.
 Is it reasonable to add this to conferences attended on my CV? I paid a decently hefty fee for registration and viewing privileges if that matters but not a member of the organisation.
 Have asked a few different people and had very different results. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have been offered a phd in a different place to my training. I&#x27;m debating on whether to take it or not? As requires moving away from family, my house, was told I should only take 6 months of maternity leave (if I do have children) during PhD. I find the subject area interesting but main motivation factor is to secure a consultant job (do not want to be an academic consultant). Anyone else in or been in this position? Would be making some personal and financial sacrifices to take up phd- not sure whether it is worth it?

                              <span>Hi everyone
 Im currently an F1 and a little bit behind on the non-core section of the personal learning log (need about 15 more hours). 
 Wondering if anyone has any quick suggestions for logging some extra hours? Im quite exhausted doing endless e-learning so if anyone has any more fun or interesting ideas I could check out that would be very helpful! 
 Thank you :)

 Made me think where do we draw the line between infection control and expression of religion? Bare below the elbow ofc is sort of BS but can I remind this nurse that religious freedom &gt; stupid infection control protocols.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m an IMG moving to London for the Foundation Programme.
 I got the following rotations:
 F1: General Surgery, Geriatric Medicine and Acute Internal Medicine at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.
 F2: Public Health/Microbiology, A&amp;E and General Surgery at Northwick Park Hospital.
 Would really appreciate the advice and experiences of anyone who&#x27;s worked at these hospitals/specialties. Thanks! :)
 PS: If anyone is interested in swapping, I would really like to swap for a GUM, ID or OBGYN rotation in F2.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have recently been offered a position as senior clinical fellow in cardiac intensive care at Harefield Hospital in London. I know about the unit and the work they do and I am very excited about this opportunity, however it would be my first time living in London so I am seeking some feedback on the post there. Are there any former/current fellows employed there I could possibly ask some &quot;practical&quot; questions to?

                              <span>F2 here. Just did form R. 31 days TOOT in total… Mostly due to IA (22/31 days). 
 I’m aware of the guidance issued by BMA, just wanted to know whether others are in the same position. Seems to be a taboo topic irl, no one really likes talking about it which is fair enough tbh. 
 31 days just seems like a lot…

 Massive insomniac and a bit desperate. Bought some daridorexant online but I haven’t had the chance to use it. I know we tend to prescribe zopiclone etc. but this in my experience isn’t restorative. (Already on a long term rx for this but won’t be using again)
 Would be grateful if anyone could share their experiences although I’m wary it’s like to be too novel.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I will be working at QEH, KL from August. Completely new to Norfolk and was hoping to get some advice from people familiar with the area regarding living and working here!
 I understand that KL is not a nice place to live, but are there any decent places nearby? 
 Is KL that bad to live in? I would prefer to be walking distance to the hospital to minimise commuting but I do have a car so I can live further. My main concern would be racism and crime - I don&#x27;t have children currently so not worried about schools and etc. If I lived in KL, my main interactions with the town outside of commuting would be going to the gym and doing groceries. For recreational stuff I would happily drive outside of KL (Norwich, Cambridge, Peterborough, hikes/exploring the surrounding areas).
 Are there any particular quirks about working at QEH I should know about? I have already ordered a hard hat 👷🏾
 Appreciate any help!

                              <span>Okay, so I&#x27;ve heard terrible things. But I&#x27;m going to be there for two years for F1+2 and I&#x27;d like to survive with my sanity intact and hopefully still want to be a doctor at the end. Practical advice for surviving please?? It would be much appreciated

                              <span>Incoming F1 and a bit worried about the fact my first two rotations are both surgical (urology then gen surg and in the same department) before moving on to geris. Everyone who I&#x27;ve told seems apprehensive and it&#x27;s got me nervous!
 What should I be doing to make it easier for when I get to my medical rotations?

                              <span>Hello hivemind. Having just been through a routine terrible induction following (another) rotation to a different trust I have accidentally become involved in improving the process. 
 This trust emails &gt;15 documents for you to review and still requires a printed and signed &#x27;checklist&#x27; to state you have accessed the relevant materials for induction.
 My plan is to streamline this into a website hosting it all and a Microsoft form checkbox to state you have reviewed and are happy with the information provided.
 The current checklist forms are overly long and onerous. A cursory Google has not shown me anything definitive for what trusts base these forms on? Is it just individual trust departments deciding what is essential to include to indemnify the trust?
 In terms of gold standard guidance for induction I am aware the BMA has some guidance (https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/career-progression/training/induction-for-junior-doctors) but again wondered if there was anything more contractually binding to what trusts should be doing for induction?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve come to ask this since this would be a great leap for me to take at the moment. I have 2 offers, 1 in NW (shithole town) and the other in one of the cities in Australia (literally in the city centre). I&#x27;m just wondering since I&#x27;m an IMG and have no ties whatsoever in the UK, the only reason why I still consider staying in the UK is the absolute pain of getting a new visa, again. Though my UK HR has been pestering me to send the documents over so they can start the visa renewal process.
 ​
 NGL, the pay in Australia is better though. I&#x27;ll be working in ED in both hospitals.

                              <span>Accs em scoresheets were released and I got marked down 2 marks for this section that&#x27;s like do you have these qualifications yes/no so is not subjective scoring just an error. I definitely remember talking about these qualifications and I also had my interview recorded as they were shortstaffed on the day. Just wanted to ask if anyone else has had this before and did it change anything like your ranking or allocation when you appealed. Thanks in advance.

 Do you group all the locums in one post and labelled it as Type of work as locum works or you need to put each locum as individual work.
 On the top it says to group shifts with one employer, then it says to include the date and number of locum shifts- how does it work?
 Thanks in advance.

These posts have all died down now so I wanted to ask have the large majority found good employment. I hadn&#x27;t heard of anyone staying unemployed so wanted to gauge what the situation was like

                              <span>This was the response from the GMC regarding if EU graduates have to sit the UKMLA in 2025 and onwards. In conculsion legalisation protocols between UK government and EU parliment are held of more value than patient safety I guess! I have got nothing against EU graduates but this is injust for every other IMG and UK graduate that have to sit this exam. Also the competency level of communicational and practical aspects of medicine from EU graduates seems to be lacking due to the profound levels of so called &#x27;Taught in English&#x27; programmes in some countries where in reality it is far from taught in english and ideally require the original language to have a just of clinical years. Also I really don&#x27;t understand how the UK government is just accepting what the EU is telling them to accept with no refute whatsoever, I suppose brexit but seriously.
 May come as a hate post for EU graduates but I sincerely don&#x27;t mean it in that way, also this post is just of conception and I am not keen on making this my identity of having to introduce the ukmla for EU graduates lmao. Just for a discussion and opinions.

                              <span>Came across a PA on Surgery. They put Mr before their name in documentation. A colleague of mine challenged the PA but the PA said that legally his title is Mr therefore he can use it. I mean technically he is correct in that his title is Mr as he is a male and not done a medical degree or a doctorate so can’t be doctor but in UK healthcare settings where surgeons go by Mr, this looks misleading

                              <span>Hello , 
 I have an upcoming national meeting and i have asked one of my seniors if i can present one of his published researches , and he accepted and the conference accepted it for an oral presentation . 
 So my name will be the ‘ presenter ‘ but i was not involved in the research , will this give me the 8 points for oral presentation in CST ? Or because i was not involved in the research it wont ?

                              <span>Does anyone know whether an audit qualifies as &quot;original research&quot; if you manage to publish an abstract summarising your results? Alternatively, does it count as &quot;other&quot; publications like letters, editorials etc?
 Have looked through the guidance and they make no specific mention of publishing large audit results.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just a quick question about CST portfolios (and surgical portfolios in general up to st3 etc) - outside of the general tick box exercises, what’s some examples of things you can add to your portfolio/CV that will make you stand out during interviews? Thanks!

                              <span>As above, anyone have any creepy stories they’ve heard or weird things they’ve experienced on nights?
 I’ll start off - our SCBU was known to be haunted, there was a dark shadow that was rumoured to be a midwife that we’d be told to ignore if we saw her on night shifts, and one of the incubators would go off at night or repeatedly show patient observations at the nursing desk when there was no baby in there. 
 I’ve also worked in a psych rehab hospital for children that used to be a war hospital - we had a parent call to check on their kid overnight only to be told by the terrified kid the parent in question had passed away years ago. Multiple staff spoke to the parent.

 I&#x27;m hoping to get onto a clinical trials research PhD but would like to apply for specialty training for the relevant specialty as well.
 Hypothetically if I was to get an offer and accept it, would it be possible to tell them I am doing a PhD and will start the training upon completion?
 Thanks in advance for help on a niche question

                              <span>Hi all, FY1 here who has started to become more and more interested in dermatology after speaking to a few friends. It seems to fit me and what I want in my career so much and now I really want to do it. I have no dermatology rotations, no papers, no society contributions, no high academic performance, like nothing to my name right now. I was a school leaver and didn’t intercalate either. What are the steps I need to take to get into dermatology? I don’t know where to begin and I know it’s insanely competitive. :(
 Is it even possible?

                              <span>I’ve been asked to cover a weekend extended access recently at my practice. Essentially it’s two sessions AM + PM on a Saturday. I would also be supervising a PA for which I get 30min allocated per session. Expectation is to see 15 patients per session (though it’s actually 12 patients as I’m supervising the PA).
 What do you think a fair rate is for this? I’ve been offered £100/hr (09:00-17:00, minus 1hr for lunch) so it would come out to be £700 total.

                              <span>Being a GP is pretty miserable at the moment, stress and costs are up and job satisfaction is hitting new lows. We’ve had approaches from companies willing to take on the GP contract and buy the surgery which sounds like a lifeline and way out but what are the downsides? Is it right to assume that they are going to be making a profit by exploiting the remaining non medical staff? By lowering the ratio of doctors to patients and making up the gaps with extra nurses? By reducing access/standards? Or are they just more efficient?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an Australian who is currently in Canada and travelling to Scotland later this year and then travelling over to India. 
 I&#x27;m looking into getting my travel vaccines for India (Hepatitis A and Typhoid) while I&#x27;m in Scotland and wondering if vaccines are covered under the Australia/UK reciprocal healthcare agreement through the NHS? 
 As Australia and Canada do not have reciprocal healthcare, getting the travel vaccines before I leave for the UK is a bit expensive and wondering if I using reciprocal healthcare would be covered/any cheaper? 
 Thank you in advance for your help!

Hi all
 Wanted to get some other opinions on this situation please. 
 So I work in an acute NHS Trust in England, and a staff member 🟢(senior nurse), is running a clinical service, and is arranging an open day for the service’s patients +their relatives (all cancer patients). 
 It involves various presentations/information, activities, all sounds great. But one thing has alarmed me a lot. Another 🔵staff member (who is non-clinical/admin, with no professional link to these patients), works in a different team, and practices Reiki in their spare time. They aspire to carry out these…</span>

                              <span>So I called 111 at 2pm yesterdaqy afternoon (Sunday), they didnt call me back until 4am, by this time I was fast asleep, and because I didnt answer all three times within the same 1 minute an emergency ambulance was dispatched, which is a complete waste of time and resources, why does this happen ? Surely they cant expect someone to wait up all the night??

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious whether anyone can offer insights here. I&#x27;ve contextualised but please be aware I am not asking for advice on my situation.
 A couple of years ago I was the victim of serious intimate partner violence. Since then I&#x27;ve accessed therapy and counselling, I&#x27;ve been on medication...no luck (don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m not seeking advice). A year ago I requested a psychiatry referral as both myself and my GP suspected PTSD and figured I could use tailored treatment and a diagnosis would help me advocate for myself. This resulted in a phone call with the Access team that lasted all of 10 minutes, I wasn&#x27;t assessed by anyone but I was discharged to Healthy Minds.
 Healthy Minds didnt help and neither did SARC. A year on and I&#x27;ve deteriorated massively, I&#x27;m completely socially withdrawn, I&#x27;ve lost 2 stone (I was 9 stone) and my personality has taken a 180 into volatility central. My ex is undergoing sentencing so my symptoms are exacerbated badly by the resurfacing of everything. In light of things getting worse I put in another referral for assessment.
 Had another phone call today and within 2 minutes they&#x27;re recommending I be discharged to Healthy Minds based on the consultant&#x27;s reading of my file (I was speaking with his secretary I think?). I wound up losing my rag and after about 20 minutes the lady began assessing me and conceded that my symptoms are in line with C-PTSD and should be reviewed.
 My question is, is this common in the mental health services in the NHS? Psychiatrists not assessing people, just skimming over their files when the referral comes through and deciding &quot;ah, it&#x27;s probably fine&quot;? I hear people lament others not calling out for help so often, but if most people are anything like me they&#x27;re begging for help and being let down by bureaucracy.

                              <span>I long to work within the NHS. I’ve applied to do 999 callhandling. But my GCSEs are bad and I’m a full time mum to 4, so going to college isn’t possible until the youngest is in school (2026). I want to return to work but I don’t want just any job. The dream is to work within the NHS. I want to be a children’s nurse or midwife, but again, I’m not sure it’s possible right now. I’m thinking start at the bottom, like receptionist job at a hospital or GP surgery. I don’t know where to start 😭Any advice would be appreciated Thank you

                              <span>My gastro has requested I make an appointment to get a blood test via this system. Has anyone got any tips on using swiftqueue? It’s not showing the hospital I want to go to and only a very restricted selection of times and dates.
 I used to just turn up, wait 10 minutes and get seen!

 The PALS team are on 15 percent and the Complaints team are on 5 percent. Does not seem entirely fair.

                              <span>Since the website JuniorDoctors.co.uk was removed, we need a platform visible to the public where we can review trusts , their departments and rate their rest facilities, quality of training. 
 This website should ideally be run by an organisation ( like the BMA maybe ) which has the contacts , funds and legal power to prevent it from shutting down. 
 I don&#x27;t trust the GMC NETS survey and neither should you. We need our independent platform run by a professional team. 
 This will not only help us make decisions but also help the public know about the issues in their local trusts. I feel it can be a powerful tool to bring changes apart from the usual guardian of freedom to speak up, other escalation pathways available for doctors locally.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I&#x27;m currently in medical school in Scotland and had a few questions about the process of applying for FY. Would be massively appreciative if anyone can offer some insight (particularly those who studied/applied to work in Scotland).
 When the time comes, I intend to place Scotland as my number 1 choice. Assuming I&#x27;m given it, how does the process of choosing a specific hospital work? I&#x27;ve heard mixed things about Scotland being split into north, east, west, and south, and being randomly allocated to one of the four regions, then another preference is required for specific hospital and then a specific job posting.
 I&#x27;m trying to plan ahead and it would be great to get some insight into how the process is meant to work and how it has worked in reality for anyone who has gone through since the system changed. I&#x27;m trying to plan ahead with my partner and want to have a better idea of what the chances of me being required to move around will be over the next few years.
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hi fellow anaesthetists!
 I was wondering about the structure of ST6 and 7, particularly with regards to SIAs. Just reading the HEE/RCOA websites, I appreciate that we apply for 1 year or 2x6-month SIAs (for London at least). How do they allocate the SIAs to us? Is there a point based system e.g. being marked for audits / projects / publications? Is there any point or weight in expressing interest early to the SIA lead in that hospital you want to go to? And during the application process, are there any tips to maximise your chances of getting the SIA you want?
 My next question then relates to what we do for the remaining 1 year. How do they decide which hospitals / jobs you do for the remaining 1 year? What is it based on, and are there any ways to maximise chances of getting the hospitals / jobs you want?
 Thank you so much in advance

                              <span>I’m just putting this out there that there is some software that you can use to help in your 10 minute consultations. Don’t ask me questions like who is the clinical safety officer or do they have DTAC compliance. Whoever uses it uses it and whoever doesn’t doesn’t, just in the same way as you use MD Calc or any other online assistance.

                              <span>Does anyone know how much registrars on the new 2016 contract (ST3 equivalent) usually make with non resident OOH rota. Talking specialties like Urology or ENT where the registrar is off site for their 24 hour on call.
 I know it’s depends on rota intensity and frequency of OOH, but anyone got any rough figures above the base of 55,300 ish?
 Many thanks.

 Am I looking in the wrong place or does the apprentice just not actually exist yet?

                              <span>Currently consultants are likely to pay some of the highest taxes with effectively 60 percent taxation between 100k and 125k due to loss of personal allowance (even worse if you get childcare or have student loans to pay). Would you support higher income tax or NI to fund the health service better given how it effects PAYE? To be sure this isn’t higher taxes to increase our salaries, it’s higher taxes for funding the NHS.

                              <span>I came across something recently. Friend matched into Residency in the US but they did med school in the UK. They graduated with a MBBS but now they are calling themselves MD. Are there any issues with this?
 I don’t think there are any issues because MD is equivalent to MBBS and it probably makes more sense to call oneself MD there as the US people are more familiar with MD being a doctor than a MBBS being a doctor 
 What do people think?

                              <span>I’m an F1 1 month into an adult inpatient psych rotation and I’m really struggling with it.
 The rota is easy and workload is absolutely fine. However, I spend my whole day shaky and on edge as I haven’t got used to the ward environment at all. For reference I’m quite a small female on an all male ward and the environment is very noisy and quite a few of the patients are very disinhibited and intimidating. A member of staff was assaulted a few weeks ago and I generally just don’t feel safe despite all the alarms and other safety measures in place. 
 I thought i would feel more comfortable by this point but I’m not sure I can hack another 3 months with my stress levels this high. 
 Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Or know any strategies that could help? Or worse case has anyone managed to switch up rotations (unlikely I know!)?

 Particularly want to know the following: What recruitment agency did you use? How long did the entire process take? Was it difficult to secure a job? Are you enjoying working in NZ?

I hope you don’t mind my question, as a doctor who is trying to get back into medicine after a career(not an easy feat), I just wondered if you yourselves might have returned from career breaks or have known anyone who has done this. How did you cope educationally?, I’m studying to re familiarise myself with things but it seems like an endless pit and therefore quite overwhelming. For any of the more senior doctors who might be reading this i would be so grateful for some advice about this. I really thank you in advance.

 I talked aloud for medical school but am aware this may be different.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Much like the junior -&gt; &quot;central&quot; -&gt; resident doctor debate, I think we can all agree that rotational training and national recruitment are awful, but it&#x27;s much harder to find a consensus on an alternative. If we&#x27;re going to change the way we train, we need to agree on what that change should look like.
 This is something I&#x27;ve put a lot of thought into over the last year or so, taking into account the many differing views on here and in real life. The following is a suggestion I&#x27;ve come up with for an alternative to our current system.
 I&#x27;m sure there are many aspects people will disagree with and many things I&#x27;ve not thought of. Please bring them up in the comments below and I&#x27;ll happily engage in the debate. This isn&#x27;t intended as a final product, rather a first step towards something we…</span>

                              <span>Good afternoon everyone,
 I have been accepted in an ACCS EM training post. Got the offer in the second week of April. Since then, I have been given the HEE visa sponsorship portal on which I have applied for a COS. I have also been contacted by my employer to fill a form but was not contacted again about placements, offer letter, rota or my TPD. I have been enrolled in the TIS self-service which required me to sign a conditions of training form and do an R form A and B.
 I am currently in a trust grade post here in the UK and never filled an R form. What is this form, and what does it include? And when is the deadline to fill it? When do we expect to have the COS in hand to apply for a visa? And is there anything that I should do in the meanwhile since I have not heard from my employer again? Is there anything else that should be done on my part at the minute?
 Sorry it&#x27;s a lot of questions but all of this is new to me.

                              <span>Hi doctors, I need your help . I have had some life events happen which has meant that I have not practised as a doctor in the last 5 years( I have worked in a medical setting for the last 2.9 years but not as a doctor ).
 I am very eager to return to medical practice but I am finding it difficult to get a job. 
 I know that there is a return to practice programme for nurses but I can’t seem to find any appropriate one for doctors.
 I did complete the medical support worker program by NHSE with good references but this was done in primary care and I assume this is not helpful to get a job in the hospital.
 I am unable to take time out for a full time clinical attachment as I can’t afford not to earn (I am the sole earner - I have a dependant).
 Does anyone know any routes available to help secure a job following this length of gap in clinical practice? 
 I am open to any suggestions or advice 
 I was at FY2/SHO level but I am happy to restart from FY1 if necessary. 
 Thank you for reading this far and I would be grateful for any help.

                              <span>Despite my efforts to secure FY1 positions, I encountered challenges due to my prior internship experience in my home country. Consequently, I am now preparing to embark on my FY2 journey with a renewed determination and enthusiasm.
 Understanding the importance of seeking guidance from experienced professionals like yourself, I am reaching out to inquire about any insights or advice you may have for someone in my situation. Specifically, I am interested in learning:
  
Which departments or specialties you believe would be most supportive for someone starting FY2 after a gap.
 Any recommendations for hospitals or deaneries known for providing effective support and guidance to doctors in similar circumstances.
 Any strategies or approaches you found helpful in transitioning smoothly into FY2 after a clinical hiatus.
  
I greatly value your expertise and perspective, and any insights you could share would be immensely beneficial as I prepare for this new chapter in my medical career.

                              <span>What is the point of foundational and rotational training?
 Why bother obtaining a CCT?
 If a PA is able to do whatever the fuck they want, why are doctors (who have graduated with an MBBS) held to much more rigorous standards?
 You can walk into primary care as a PA without any prior experience, but a GPST3 who passes their AKT but fails their SCA is considered incompetent to practice as a GP. Similarly, you don&#x27;t need an MRCS to practice surgery. Just become a PA or SCP.
 I&#x27;m curious who is spearheading this change. Why is this country so hellbent on destroying what was once considered a prestigous profession?
 I&#x27;m astonished.
 I don&#x27;t see any other solution other than defunding the Royal Colleges. I&#x27;m glad I cancelled my membership last year. A colossal waste of money.

                              <span>On this subreddit we often talk about how bad the NHS model is (in terms of healthcare provision and as an employer for us) whilst also simultaneously talking about how bad the USA model. People inevitably vaguely say we should follow a French or Australian or etc model instead. I just wonder what do meddit think this actually involves and what would it practically look like in a UK context? This is completely just a thought experiment as I appreciate its not something that&#x27;s gonna happen.

I myself am appearing tomorrow after failing twice last year. I&#x27;m confident about my preparation this time (atleast relative to the last two attempts). Here&#x27;s hoping we all ace it tomorrow! I&#x27;ve created this thread to benefit not just the doctors writing the exam tomorrow but also so that the discussion that follows will be beneficial to all candidates appearing in the future. God speed.

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking of setting up a med ed course &amp; wanted some suggestions. 
 Most specialty applications require 2 days of training in teaching methods. These usually cost £200+ &amp; I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve always found them to be the most helpful when looking at their content. I&#x27;m also keen that these things should be free as it&#x27;s expensive enough getting into specialty training. 
 I&#x27;m thinking of building an e-learning course with some virtual face to face content (to meet the criteria of CST applications, but also to discuss project ideas and get feedback). I&#x27;d be running it with my experience of setting up medical education projects locally, regionally &amp; nationally through Mind the Bleep. The team at Mind the Bleep is made of over 200 doctors now - so plenty of people to provide expertise. 
 The content I&#x27;m thinking to cover would include - Briefly educational theory with a focus on what matters in the real world - Overview and practicalities of how to set up/organise or run the different types of medical education (bedside, tutorial and small group teaching, lectures, simulation, webinars, e-learning courses &amp; websites) including curriculum, assessment, feedback &amp; teaching methods 
 I&#x27;d love some advice. My worries are - There won&#x27;t be formal external accreditation. This costs upwards of a thousand pounds which isn&#x27;t feasible. That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t help &amp; CPD accreditation doesn&#x27;t appear to be necessary on any portfolio - Utility of this programme as I really want to create something that is useful to people teaching. Is this the content people want? Will it be used &amp; so worth the enormous time &amp; effort we&#x27;ll have to put in to create this?

                              <span>Good luck to all sitting part B this couple of weeks!
 Just wanted to ask something regarding the examination stations. Do we continuously recite what we are doing at each step of the examination to the examiner, or do we just do the examination with the patient in mind, pretend that the examiner is not there and then summarise +ve and -ve findings at the end?
 Sorry if this was asked before, I had a search through the subreddit but couldn&#x27;t find anyone asking this before. Thanks!

                              <span>I am an F1 who is going to apply for IMT this winter for next year, one of the big deciding factors in this is the crazy competition ratios from this year and lack of job security meaning a F3 isn’t as viable as it once was. 
 Points-wise I should have enough to scrape an interview this year with about 18/30 points but what can I be doing in my f2 year to help for IMT?
 In F2 I plan on doing an online teach the teacher course and finishing an audit I’m currently doing which will give me 2/3 more points. 
 Is it worth trying to arrange some clinics on my medicine block or carry out more of the acute take? Is prepping for MRCP part 1 a good idea? 
 Is there anything else I could be doing to show commitment/readiness for IMT?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Sorry for the hundredth F1 post. I&#x27;ve googled and searched back through the sub but can&#x27;t find much. My first rotation for F1 is AMU at a relatively large DGH. I understand it&#x27;ll be mostly common medical presentations (CAP, PE, CHF, DKA, IBD, etc), but what can I expect from a typical day to day? 
 I&#x27;ve read it&#x27;s all clerkings and PTWR? And whilst we&#x27;re at it... what exactly is a PTWR? It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been thrown around for the last 5 years but I&#x27;m no closer to understanding what it means. 
 Thanks all in advance!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am one of the IMT doctors who is on training at the moment. Planning for ST4 Cardiology in the future as well. 
 I have multiple audits done under cardiology, have completed relevant data collections for research purpose as well. I have analyzed the data already and on the process of writing the Abstract and the research paper. 
 Is there any way I can get it published without any cost? All the platforms I looked for needs a good chunk of money for publication fee. 
 Thanks in advance guys

                              <span>I’m at my wits’ end. I am a junior reg in a surgical specialty, and am rostered to theatre lists once every 2 weeks (sad I know). I would prep the list days in advance, get to the hospital early just to find out that another newly CCT-ed consultant just did a ‘surprise pikachu’ and will be joining the list. 
 Of course they don’t just ‘join’ per se, more like do the entire list with the consultant. My poor senior reg only got to put in the ports and did a bit of bowel manipulation. Needless to say, I didn’t get to do very much. 
 When will I actually learn?!? What should I do? I am friendly with all the consultants, and am worried that escalating this will cause some bad blood. I get it that training as been paltry during Covid, but I DO NOT want to CCT and be a consultant that steals lists from my juniors. 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I’m in despair.

                              <span>I left after F1 for Aus. Wow it&#x27;s different, currently I we have 6 Doctors for an average of roughly 15 patients including a fellow (IMG Consultant) and 2 training Regs. Nurses do all cannulas and bloods.
 My interns have done about 3 cannulas over the last 6 weeks. I have only done a cannula in an arrest.
 I go to theatre twice a week and assist as an F2, I get to do abscesses. I have clinic once a week. We get coffee shouted for us every single morning and sometimes we even get it twice.
 I take home roughly £3.4k a month and every second day someone gets sent home early. I got £1.25k for professional development, aka I bought a new phone.
 Things over there seem worse than when I left. Stop staying just for family, you barely see them and might get whisked off to any part of the country at a moments notice, I have 6 week of leave I can take in a chunk to see family etc. I have full autonomy over my specialties and career here, I even changed last minute because I heard one I was intending to do was shit basically.
 I genuinely love my job, sometimes I even stay a bit later (get paid for it) for the banter. I work roughly 2 on call shifts a month and have 0 nights this year. Everyday I wake up and it&#x27;s 20+ degrees, there&#x27;s not a cloud in the sky. The beach is 15 mins away for a nice stroll and an ice cream watching the sunset (I&#x27;m always home for it).
 Please fire away any questions

                              <span>...Hello, as title said just want to ask for peoples experiences/advice - sorrry for long-ish post but i feel it&#x27;s good to give context! I know a lot of this will be dependent on my personal circumstances but if anyone has any experiences of following either path and can offer reassurance/caution then it would be most appreciated! 
 I am an EM ST3 runthrough trainee struggling with mental health secondary to work and have therefore lost passion for it which I did have at the beginning of ST3. I like EM and want to continue working in it in the future. Plan to finish ST3 but a bit stuck about what to do after this. Current state of burnout/depression is likely a long term build up with a couple of specific incidences that put me over the edge. 
 Options as I see it are to continue training dropping down to LTFT and trying to push for some sort of career break (which i&#x27;ve been told is unlikely given i wouldn&#x27;t do something clinical). As a run through trainee, knowing it would be hard to get back as an ST4 in my region if I left, this seems like a sensible option but the thought of continuing training doesn&#x27;t do anything for my sense of apathy/low mood. 
 Or drop my number and locum (i am financially dependent on work and don&#x27;t have an option to not work) with a plan to trust grade/CESR in the future. The idea of a break and having some control over things makes me feel great but I&#x27;m nervous about the uncertainty/isntability this introduces going forward with my career. 
 I am doing everything i feel is needed to address mental health (counselling/occy health) and my department are aware of these issues/have offered time off if i feel like this is what i need. 
 Thanks in advance (on nights sorry if i don&#x27;t reply to people quickly)

                              <span>Opinions on Peninsula for foundation training and ACCS training?
 Myself going into final year of med school and partner who’s F2 are both from North West but are looking at maybe moving to Peninsula for training. We’re wanting opinions on the hospitals in the region for foundation and ACCS training. 
 Do people love it/hate it? What’s teaching like? Is the mess active? Is it a nice place to live, things to do? 
 Any help would be very appreciated!

                              <span>Everyone knows NHS pay is rubbish but these are the parts of the contract (mat leave) you&#x27;d at least expect to be decent (or is it just me?)
 Instead you have mat leave that&#x27;s far far worse then any reputable private sector job in London. Was quite shocked when I first saw those terms 
 No point in this post besides expressing genuine surprise and seeing if I&#x27;m in the minority to feel this way

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been really struggling on my new ward which is gastro. It&#x27;s chronically understaffed, often just having two SHOs for 32 patients and it&#x27;s struggle for me at least, to see 16 patients and keep on top of TTOs etc. with some jobs e.g. making referrals to other specialties, getting delayed for days at a time. I usually leave 1-2 hours late, and last week had a seven day week in which I worked almost 70h. SpRs are generally absent in clinic or on endoscopy lists.
 There is a consultant ward round three times a week, but their minimalist style also causes me some stress. They virtually never examine patients, no matter how ill, their histories rarely longer than 30s, and perhaps I&#x27;m just missing something, but they seem to have an offhand/ not very clearly well reasoned approach to ordering…</span>

                              <span>I have an ex healthcare worker on my ward in a side room with leg ulcers that’s being treated with IVs, she’s been here since the beginning of my rotation and she’s gonna be here for a while. 
 Today she went home for the afternoon and I found her crying in her room when she came back. Her granddaughter apparently said she doesn’t smell like home anymore, and she already has severe mental health decline because of this issue and it’s just kinda tipped her over the edge. I’m wondering if I brought her a reed diffuser for her hospital room to match her favourite smell if that would be inappropriate?

                              <span>At the trust I work in, I’ve noticed that patients menu are better quality than the cafe. At the canteen it’s very unhealthy food- all fried and an abundance of chips. I’ve asked them to add more vegetables and it’s seldom there. When patients don’t eat food, it goes to the bin. When the cafe food doesn’t get eaten, it gets “recycled” I.e. compost, and there’s a sign on the table proudly declaring that all food goes to compost. They charge an extortionate amount for the disgusting food and chuck half of it away. 
 Why does NHS waste so much food and why can’t they give us food, even if it’s just the left overs. Half the time on evening shifts there are no cafes open. How could they expect us to work hungry. I just don’t get how inhumane these trusts are. Yet 2 billion to spend on a stupid app is ok. But food for staff is not ok.

                              <span>Hey guys, we are planning for a baby and trying to work out if we can afford it. 
 We hope to start trying this year - I just wondered with regards to mat pay, if there is a couple of months of time off between August - Dec, will this affect the whole &quot;NHS continuous service for 12 mths&quot; unless she does some locums on the hospital bank between those months?

                              <span>Quick question. 
 Can we CCT from training here and flee to Australia or other countries as consultant the moment we finished training? Or is there a hidden rule where we have to work as a consultant in UK for minimum number of years before this can be transferred internationally?
 Thanks!

 Introducing 
 1) Diploma in pharmacy- You can then apply to be chief pharmacist 2) Diploma in Nursing- you can become chief nurse overseeing all matrons 3) Diploma in paramedic science- you can become chief or whatever title run the show 4) Feel free to add more.
 Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard of the adage that using skin glue or steristrips over a wound closed with e.g. Monocryl implies that the surgeon isn&#x27;t confident that the closure is sound, but surely it&#x27;s in the patient&#x27;s best interest to have solid reinforcement with skin glue or steristrips? 
 Can you apply glue over the closed incision and then use steristrips over them to minimise tension across the wound? 
 Do you favour one over the other?

Also this idea that UK doctors have to serve a minimum years in the NHS doesn&#x27;t sound legal either.

                              <span>Dear All, I am an International Medical Graduate, and here in the UK for my PLAB 2 exam. I have color blindness, it’s strong protanopia ( Red/Green deficiency). Practically i can be able to differentiate traffic signal/ sometimes i get confused between Red/Green/Orange/yellow. 
 I can identify the standard colours, when the shades vary, like dark green - i say brown. Light green- that’s yellow to me. ( the cheese and onion Lays - crisp i’m still confused whether it’s yellow or Green, you can google it. i hope, you must have guessed my country now!! )
 This is my very first post in Reddit, i eventually will inform the GMC during my GMC registration. I felt whenever we say inform DVLA to patients ( well, OSCE scenario ) that hurts me, because in my back of the mind, i wanted to avoid this to GMC. But not anymore, I decided to inform them! 
 It’s not my fault having a faulty glorious X gene! 
 The purpose of this post is, if any fellow colleague/ if anyone knew anyone who has mentioned about CB during the GMC registration, i want to know how they proceed? Any tests? Any precaution!
 During my MBBS and Post-graduation in back home, i had to undergo a special screening in ophthalmology which was fun! I’m eager to know what the GMC do, usually!!
 Thank you. Looking forward for everyone’s inputs!
 PS: my speciality of interest is Internal Medicine, Cardiology!! 
 And i couldn’t edit the wrong spelling for the word Colour above! Apologies-:) for those who got hurt for the wrong spelling, even my eyes hurt when i see a wrong spelling! Unfortunately couldn’t edit! 
 Cheers everyone!

                              <span>At present there is 1 PA in the department I work in. There are approximately 20 junior doctors on the rota who are more qualified and have been practicing fair longer than they have. 
 For some fucking reason the consultants absolutely adore this PA. They do all the LPs, PICC lines, sees patients independently, makes discharge calls which the consultants handwave through, orders investigations with ionising radiation which has been highlighted numerous times but continues to happen etc. 
 All this and they&#x27;ve been &quot;qualified&quot; for less than 18 months. Before they were a PA they had no health care experience. When my colleagues and I were doing our FY1s they were working in hospitality. 
 I feel like I&#x27;m working in clown land and it&#x27;s driving me insane. Meanwhile my colleagues and I are struggling to get clinical skills experiences and they seem to be serving them up to this PA on a silver platter. 
 I&#x27;m furious and no one seems to be taking any notice of how absurd this all is.

                              <span>Hi guys
 I am not sure how things are among different NHS trusts but in ours, the ward manager and the ward clerks are always on our back chasing us to do these forms periodically although we are understaffed (seeing 12/13 patients per junior doctor) in an acute setting wards with no registrars to help. We explained to them that we are busy seeing patients, discussing plans with the cons, doing the jobs, doing the discharges, updating the family and many of us even missing their breaks to try to finish on time and literally there is no space left to do these forms. Lately, the ward manager hinting that they will escalate to the trust managers and indirectly implying we are neglecting it on purpose!
 How do you think we should handle this issue? 
 Thanks

 Both times i basically dropped marks in phy and pre op post op.

                              <span>My sister’s friend has been trying to get a junior doctor job in the UK for the past year or so. The last time I saw her, she was visibly upset and ranting to my sister. I heard her say something about “Too many PAs and no jobs for junior doctors”. She asked my opinion and I had no idea about this.
 So what’s the deal with PA and new junior doctors not being able to get a job?
 Totally new to this so please be kind and patient with your responses. TIA

 https://www.nhsemployers.org/system/files/2024-04/Pay-and-Conditions-Circular-%28MD%29-1-2024_2.pdf
 As we know, this now includes:
  
A reduction in the number of pay points in the pay scale.
 An increase in starting pay.
 An increase in pay at the top of the pay scale.

 I believe the numbers have been estimated and discussed in a previous post, but since we have the exact figures to hand now, what is the overall consensus?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I was reading some guidelines in my hospital about CCF patients and found that, 
 90% of acute CCF patients will be hypertensive on presentation, only 5% will be hypotensive. 
 Is it true? Any papers on that? Interested to read more Couldn&#x27;t find any reference

 Do you get a free lap simulator training box when you start CST in the West Midlands deanery? 
 Wanna know if I should buy one.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I am a nurse and I think it is discusting how we still have heard nothing regarding this years payrise. The conditions in which we have to work in: the unsafe staffing levels, the abuse, the long hours, the stress, I even had to put in a sexual harassment case and that’s without mentioning that great job nurses do at saving lives/healing people. Yet we are not being rewarded for what we do. I don’t understand why nothing is being done and why it is not being more widely talked about. 
 More and more I consider leaving my career as a nurse as it seems more unworthwhile. Anyone else have similar feelings?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I’ve received a formal offer after pre employment checks that took what felt about 600 weeks to complete🤣
 My dad works for the NHS and has a car through the lease scheme. Does anyone have any useful advice for someone who’s looking to join the scheme? Is it limited to specific bands etc? 
 Thanks

                              <span>So I got a letter in for my first smear test. I don’t want to get it because of the pain but I know it’s life saving. 
 First of I have anxiety about going to the doctors in general. Getting a smear test no thank you.
 A few years ago I got the coil to help my periods. The pain was excruciating with the speculum. For two days the cramps were unbearable, I had to go to A&amp;E for pain medicine, after 2 days I got it out and that was worse than getting it inserted.

 There was staff team telling muslim staff member “you can’t just marry all these woman” jokingly. But it seemed unprofessional as they’ll come across this
 A charge nurse muttered under her breathe at me “honest to god man” 
 (i know there isn’t much context here but my treatmeant was so bad and its let my trust down for services)

I don&#x27;t have a dentist, I know I need a root canal treatment (as my last dentist a while back said I will) which no way I can afford private, I&#x27;m already late on rent... I sent a enquiry at a dentist office to see if they&#x27;re taking new NHS patients but I&#x27;m only going to get an answer tomorrow since it&#x27;s a Sunday. I&#x27;m also waiting for a call back from 111 though im not hopeful they can help much since I can&#x27;t afford private treatment. Is there anything else I can do? At least some way to get a stronger painkiller in the meantime (like Naproxen which has worked well in the past)? I haven&#x27;t cried from pain since I was a child, it&#x27;s horrible, I&#x27;m sorry if I don&#x27;t make sense I haven&#x27;t been able to get any sleep. Thank you for reading any help is welcome

 I am thinking of applying for the above mentioned specialty, however, I would like to know more about what the trainees do during their normal working week. How much of the workload does the GIM cover comprises of? What clinics can you do?
 I would really appreciate if someone helped with some answers.

                              <span>-Throwaway account -
 Recently I was on-call as medical registrar in a trust I&#x27;ve worked in for a long time. Locum consultant was working in the emergency department.
 There was a medical emergency in an outpatient area with no medical equipment nearby. The patient had ongoing central crushing chest pain.
 Apart from patient having normal obs and known significant cardiac history I wasn&#x27;t able to do much. Nearest crash trolley was also far away and I did the only thing that made sense to me at the time and took the patient to ED.
 I told the nurse in charge that the patient needs assessment and if they have no emergency needs I&#x27;m happy to admit the patient to the medical team.
 I got a call from the ED consultant a little while later and they were angry I hadn&#x27;t discussed this with them and did not want to discuss this with me. Instead told me they are putting this patient on the medical list. When I explained that this might not be safe/ appropriate. They got angry and insisted they were the consultant and I&#x27;m the reg so I must listen. They won&#x27;t engage with me and only wanted to speak to my consultant.
 My consultant also said the same thing as I did.
 Patient was completely fine. all bloods/ ecg/ xray normal. patient got sent to the ambulatory services (I asked nurse to refer to the ambulatory service) and eventually discharged.
 the ED consultant has written an email to my supervisor stating my &#x27;rudness was a serious matter&#x27; and that he wants to be kept updated as this is something he feels he should refer to the GMC - not verbatim because I can&#x27;t remember the details of the email.
 I&#x27;m confused about this reaction. a little worried about the potential GMC complaint. But thankful the patient is completely fine. Any advise on what I should do / has anyone else been in a similar position?

                              <span>Another post by an IMG wanting to use the U.K. speciality training programme and leave. Half the IMGs I talk to, especially GPs, state the same. 
 It is truly infuriating to see when countless home grads are being completely fucked. Unable to secure a training space, because we have a system that shows no favour to home graduates. Who typically are less likely to move post CCT than IMG counterparts. 
 This issue is just getting worse. How are fresh graduates expected to compete with those that have had numerous years collecting points for self assessment scores and examination prep from abroad?
 Even if the government tripled the training places overnight. It does not fix this problem. 
 The RMLT is dead. However we need a new system. This is going to lead to hundreds if not thousands unemployed after F2. Like what is currently happening.

                              <span>!! Urgent - please help / advise !!
 I booked and paid for the MRCS Part A exam in Feb but all the PearsonVue correspondence went to the junk folder of my NHS mail.
 This means that despite paying and being accepted for the exam, I have not received a test centre appointment anywhere and seems like I am unable to sit the exam next week, despite months of hard work and paying the exam fee.
 Does anyone have any advice on what to do in this situation? it is a bank holiday and can’t get through to anyone.
 Will this count as an attempt, despite not having a test centre appointment?
 Since I have paid for the exam, will the RCSEd be able to refund part or defer my exam to September?
 Any advice would be most appreciated, as you can imagine all very stressful!

                              <span>I apologise for this long post filled with self-pity. I am going through a tough time and would appreciate any advice or simply someone who has been in a situation like mine and can say that things will get better.
 I am a 34-year-old IMT2 who is soon to turn 35 (I know, not your usual 27 yrs SHO). It took me quite a while to determine my specialisation, and there were occasions when I had to step away from my profession due to family or personal issues, which lengthened my journey.
 I am struggling with a lot of guilt and shame being an older IMT2; not passing MRCP has also exacerbated my feelings of shame. Overall, I am a safe doctor and have received lovely feedback from colleagues and seniors, so I am grateful for that. Additionally, I struggle with depression (not yet diagnosed) and h…</span>

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 Have been asked to swap to an on-call shift next week by rota coordinators as a last minute thing due to rota gaps, was meant to be on a normal day. Can we get paid on-call wage for having to do these shifts (within normal hours)? Any other things that we can claim for?
 Thanks

                              <span>When I was a core surgical trainee, getting lap choles was like gold dust. You wait and wait. Assist over a 100. Memorise the steps. Keep praying that it would not be necrotic and gangrenous and was only a bit inflamed. You hoped the patient would be otherwise fit. You wished that you would have a consultant or SpR who was a tiny bit interested in training and that they would let you do it. You check the imaging, consent, you do the sign in, you prep and drape and wait. You know you can do this safely with guidance and if it is difficult, you will hand it over. You just want the opportunity. 
 In my 2 years as a General Surgery core trainee, I did a grand total of FIVE lap choles skin-to-skin. FIVE over 2 years. These were elective ones. Never got a chance to do an acute LC. I heard a lot …</span>

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Would be grateful for some advice. 
 I’m a GPST3 that was due to CCT in Aug and and start further speciality training immediately after. 
 Unfortunately, I’ve needed an extension on my GP training due to not meeting my portfolio requirements. 
 I’ve let my TPDs know already and I’ll get in touch with HEE to let them know. 
 Will this result in my speciality training post in the new post being pulled? 
 Thank you for any advice.

 One example is that you will be the sole SHO covering wards and clerking new admissions overnight with little to no support as seniors will be in theatre. 
 Is this accurate? What knowledge should I ideally brush up on before starting? Any tips/tricks for the job?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I appreciate that this may not be a binary answer, but I often see DNACPR forms filled with &quot;frailty, poor physiological reserve&quot;. (They&#x27;ve all been completely appropriate). 
 I recently had a talk where a geris reg said &quot;if they&#x27;re &lt;65, they&#x27;re not frail, something else is going on&quot;. It would help for my understanding to know how one decides that somebody is frail. Some examples would be useful!
 Edit: For context, the thing that got me thinking about this is the more marginal cases, rather than 95 year old Doris who lives in a care home.

                              <span>Hi all, as it says in the title - I&#x27;m a current FY2 going to take a locum FY3 year and am planning to apply for ACCS EM into ICM at some point down the line. Any advice on which exams are best to sit in FY3 year when I have some actual time to revise to boost my application? I&#x27;m planning to do MRCEM Primary but is it worth doing MRCP and/or APLS course as well?
 FRCA Primary seems to be limited to those in a training programme, sadly...

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a haematology ST6-7 who has moved deaneries to be closer to family. The new deanery does things a bit differently and some of my upcoming rotations will require me to do med reg cover of the hospital at night. The hospital doesn&#x27;t have the big cardio/resp/gastro wards but has a wide selection of miscellaneous medical and surgical specialities.
 While on paper I have all the requisite skills (MRCP, ALS, see a lot of acutely unwell inpatients in haematology) I feel quite anxious about being the medical point of call for the hospital given it has been about 5 years since I did any &quot;proper&quot; general medicine.
 Has anyone been in a similar position and/or have some advice on how to effectively refresh med reg skills? I&#x27;m aware I&#x27;m probably overthinking it, and there is a genuine med reg at a neighbouring hospital I could call if I&#x27;m stuck, but I&#x27;d like to go into it feeling vaguely prepared!
 Thanks.

                              <span>I was identified as “instructor potential” for a recent course I did. Was pretty pleased about this so was texting my sister about it (who is a non medic). This was her response
 “Ok, but will they pay you for all this work? Is it on top of your current rota? Don’t just say ‘yes’ if there’s no real direct benefit to you. I get a lot of these kinds of emails—“congratulations, you’re eligible to do all this extra work…but we won’t actually meaningfully compensate you.” “ I kind of initially was a bit annoyed but then had a little check-in with myself. I did think oh its good for the old Cv coming up to CCT etc. But yeah thats about it. Dont get paid for it. 
 Anyway thought id share the deep seated manipulation of extra curricula being expected and us going along with it with no real financial compensation whatsoever

                              <span>Hi All, I am starting ST4 training in KSS this September. They haven’t sent the allocation yet to east or west. I would like to know more about the rotation there. Is it possible for me to reside in one place and commute during the 4 years? Any good areas for a family with young kids starting schools? Also, I want to hear for trainees there if there is anything I should prepare or do before starting my training. Many thanks.

Am I meant to now apply for my Skilled Worker visa through the ‘applying from outside UK’ process? Can I apply under the ‘switch’ criteria? (previously was under the Tier 2 student visa). Could someone please clarify this? Much appreciated!

                              <span>My ES has done my supervisor report for IMT 3. I noted a section on DOPS but did get any DOPs signed off this year as I was signed off last year... Will this be an issue at ARCP?
 
My QI project states I &#x27;showed leadership&#x27; and &#x27;managed the project effectively&#x27;- will this suffice for demonstrating leadership for the IMT3 ARCP?
 
 Thank ya!
 Super stressed on my night shifts.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I would like to request a medical record from: https://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/about-us/your-health-records/managing-your-data
 You are required to show ID for the request. Is it possible to send in a scan of an original ID? I don&#x27;t feel comfortable posting it, as I don&#x27;t know if I would get it back. 
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>About 7 months ago I damaged my MCL and LCL. I had an MRI scan and the doctor showed me the results.
 My question is, can I request a copy of the scan just to have it for myself or do I need to have a valid reason for why I&#x27;m requesting it?

                              <span>So my practice now gives the option to book to see a GP for £50 through the Patient Access app, which I guess is just a private GP…
 I’m tempted to do this in order to be seen sooner for some recurring health issues but will doing so “un-register” me at my GP? Feel like I’ve read this somewhere but maybe I’m imagining it. Can anyone shed some light? I have no idea how the whole Patient Access thing works.

I know BSMSA &amp; AMSPAR, specialise in medical training, but having been bought up with Pitman training burnt into my young mind in the 70s as the holy grail of secretarial training, I wonder if it&#x27;s still as relevant today.

                              <span>I have applied to an NHS administrator job &amp; have an interview in a couple of weeks. I put down three references. Job 1 covers four years, job 2 covers 6 months &amp; my current job covers 1 year and 7 months. 
 I’m just worried about job 2 because I don’t have any contact details for that company and it was a remote job so I can’t find a proper address or email address either. 
 I had a job between job 1 and 2 as well tbh but didn’t list it as a reference because they were a strange company with strange people. (It is on my CV though)
 Anyway, if I could only provide references for a job I left in 2021 and my current job, would that be an issue? I haven’t got the job yet obviously but I’m just thinking ahead 😂

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for next steps on how to improve really.
 I applied for Genomic Counselling. Have a 1st class undergrad degree in Genetics, a masters in Genomic Medicine, 1 year experience in care, some teaching experience, 1 year experience in social work, and 3 years in crisis counselling. I also have Level 2s and 3s in counselling related things.
 Unfortunately, after my 3rd time going at this, I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss. I was on the shortlist reserve last year, but couldn&#x27;t even shortlist this year. Not sure how I got worse with a masters degree, but alas. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m going wrong or where to go from here.
 I&#x27;ve spoken to my university peers who have told me to get experience in a lab, others have said to do a GC MSc at another university, others said to try for in-service.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any experience in STP GC in-service entry? Or any tips on how to improve my application for next year? Or even any advice on what else I can do instead?
 I appreciate any help!
 Any tips on lab experience will be great, also. I have no lab experience as my undergrad was during covid and my postgrad was all bioinformatics based

                              <span>I am a fairly recently CCTd GP and regularly overrun
 When I really focus on time management, I can keep to time with ~ 15 min delays
 But when I&#x27;m not actively focusing on it...I will overrun 30-40 mins
 I much prefer overrunning and having positive/productive consults and find that when I do overrun patients actually seem happier with the consults (in spite of initial frostiness for lateness)
 If it were up to me, I&#x27;d just accept overrunning for more productive consults. But I don&#x27;t think my colleagues (admin/partners) seem too pleased about this
 I wanted to find out a) how much people overrun b) how people manage to have productive consults while keeping to strict time?

                              <span>Hi,
 My dad is a GP partner in the process of partial retirement under the October 2023 changes which state:
 From 1 October 2023, members of the 1995 Section have also been able to take partial retirement. From this date, the amount of benefits members are able to take when partially retiring changed so that members will be able to partially retire and claim up to 100% of their pension benefits from any Section or Scheme.
 My dad and his accountant are being passed from pillar to post by the various agencies (PCSC, ICB etc) and it’s become incredibly stressful for all involved. 
 Anybody have any experience with this process or any advice? He’s a BMA member so has reached out to them also.
 Thanks all

                              <span>I’ve found 2 prolonged absences from work over the last few years has dented my confidence a bit. Day to day work is fine and I enjoy it but I get flustered by emergencies OOH particularly if the clinical picture is rapidly changing or not clear-cut. 
 I’ve been coming back to this one interaction a few times and would like some feedback as to what / why I went wrong. As medical SHO one weekend, I was asked to see an elderly patient who was unresponsive. From memory they were on IV abx for chest infection and were multimorbid, but had been trundling along fairly well until that evening when they had pretty quickly become drowsy and then stopped responding to nurses. 
 By the time I turned up they were responsive to pain but not voice, so I did an A-E assessment, went over all recent invest…</span>

                              <span>We agreed to a new rota / work schedule that began in Feburary which includes an extra twilight shift but a cut in number of nights. Our overall pay isn&#x27;t massively different.
 3 months on, we still haven&#x27;t received an updated work schedule with our new shift pattern, despite numerous emails. 
 What exactly is the next step in this situation ? Do we involve the BMA ?

                              <span>Exception reported a late finish of almost 2 hours a few weeks back due to the consultant “forgetting” they were on duty and turning up super late, meaning that my jobs were piling up at like 3pm in the afternoon. 
 I was not going to hand over half my day workload to the night team so I stayed late to complete what I could and then exception reported to my ES over the next few days. 
 Fast forward to just recently, was brought aside by my CS who asked me if I’ve been better with my time management skills, clearly referencing my exception report in the conversation.
 I almost blurted out “MY time management skills???”. 
 I did kindly reminded them the actual reason I stayed late and they went off a tangent and the original meaning of the conversation trailed off quickly.
 I have no idea what’s been going on behind the scenes with my seniors discussing my exception report but there sure is some bs going on.

                              <span>Hey,
 Sorry if this has been asked recently but I was wondering if anyone had any good resources to help me prepare for ICM training. In particular, any (very) basic guides to ventilators and settings. I have tried to get my head around it but every time I think I understand something, I seem to be back at square 1... I am quite a book learner, so if anyone has any good book recommendations that would be great (and of course websites as well!) As a medic intensivist, I really want to have a basic understanding before I start about BiPAP, CPAP, PS, SMV, etc...
 Thanks!!

                              <span>When I was looking for my first job over 10 years ago, I remember being caught up in a pyramid scheme for a few months. It was some sort of door to door alarm sales company - you had to &quot;buy in&quot; for a few hundred quid, and as you rose up the ranks, the promise was that success and riches were just a step away. &quot;Excellence&quot; rewards for high sales, then having your first mentees who would pay fees up to you, then having your first patch of territory where a % of proceeds went to you. The promises were constant and relentless. Simultaneously, there was a very strange culture of pathologic positivity, and anyone who questioned the system was labelled a negative person and sidelined. In the end it became apparent to me the whole thing was a scam, but my teenage naivety kept me in longer than id…</span>

 I have a community geriatrics job in FY1 which I&#x27;m a bit nervous about. Does this involve home visits? Or is it in a community hospital?
 In FY2, I have a max-fax job and literally know nothing about this speciality. What do I expect?
 I&#x27;m also worried, I&#x27;ll be deskilled as this job seems quite supernumerary whereas some of my other friends have got ICU/AMU/ED/GP jobs which I feel will make you a more well-rounded confident doctor in managing general medical conditions. 
 I feel like I&#x27;ve missed out on some key &quot;general&quot; jobs and instead got some niche ones like OMFS and haematology (which is another FY2 job).
 Any help is appreciated!

 I’m sorry but this should be a national fucking disgrace that we’re letting people start core training with potentially zero interest in psychiatry and/or zero communication skills. 
 Using just the MSRA is pure laziness / cost cutting by the Royal College and frankly we are doing a disservice to some of the most vulnerable and marginalised patients by recruiting into the speciality this way. Even for GP recruitment you’re asked to answer some basic white space questions. 
 Anyways, the point of this post is to ask everyone who applied this year to please fill out the feedback form sent by the Psychiatry National Recruitment Office on 01/05 (subject: Regarding your 1 Core Psychiatry Training Application). Tell them they need to fix up. I have. 
 Kind regards, A disgruntled MSRA flopper

                              <span>I am hoping to have some insight I am on the wait list for an ear surgery but they have told me I will need 2 weeks of recovery after so I cannot work for 2 weeks. The issue I have is I dont have an offical date yet but I call today saying can I go for surgery tomorrow as they had an opening. I&#x27;ve been waiting for over a year for the procedure. I had no idea if I could say yes and suddenly not be at work or if I would be in trouble for saying yes and having the surgery. I said no sorry but now I really hate myself and think would it been oaky if I said yes? I dont know how much longer I have to wait now to get a date and just not sure what to do

                              <span>Sorry I haven’t been able to find an answer for this elsewhere on Reddit, nor on HEE website. I’ve been allocated a PACES sitting at the opposite end of the country - train + hotel is going to cost a fortune… I’m aware some training programs can get travel/ accommodation for their exam reimbursed. Is this the case for IMT?

                              <span>Would a PA be more likely, consciously or subconsciously, to not progress a concern in a patient as they can’t directly prescribe etc. 
 I am thinking of the cases where patients have their concerns dismissed by a PA, and it turns out they needed medical attention after all.
 We can all be biased of course, however I am getting a feeling of frustration by PAs not being able to prescribe etc.

                              <span>Recently had an ES meeting with review of a MSF/TAB type feedback. Vast majority globally positive and complimentary. However multiple references to, and 2 &quot;needs improvements&quot; on approach to risk/acting beyond my grade (core anaesthetics). We discussed the basis of this. There was one incident which was an objectively stupid decision made in the heat of the moment - I won&#x27;t detail much but involved taking my eye off the ball and increasing risk. No patient harm arose (fortunately) and the case progressed uneventfully, no SI/datix, but ES rightfully described as &quot;a really big cock-up&quot;, &quot;it makes me concerned you haven&#x27;t grasped the risks of anaesthetics&quot;. Other than this incident feedback seemed to relate to how I come across rather than any specific incident. 
 The stupid decision in question was some time ago and my ES seemed relieved at how much I&#x27;d reflected on it immediately after and since and my ownership of my mistake. Said just not to make it a pattern and all should be ok. I am accepting of feedback and strive to improve. 
 Generally in life I am someone who can just make stupid mistakes in a variety of settings &quot;in the moment&quot; and regret them intensely after. I have been humbled by this and other dicey anaesthetic experiences (where there was no question at all that I had acted completely appropriately). I believe I am good at recognising risk before and after things and will counsel patients appropriately, ask for senior help at the first whiff of risk. What I&#x27;m looking for is advice on how to be better at making good clinical decisions in the moment and intuitively minimising risk, a quality I want to work on. Any advice would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hospital I work at has an SDEC where the AMU ACPs triage all the incoming SDEC referrals from GP and ED. 
 Is this standard procedure? 
 NB: there is technically a consultant around, but very minimally involved in decision making process to admit. 
 More importantly, minimally involved in declining referrals.
 As a result, the SDEC clerking list is unnaturally and inappropriately long with cases that should could have been avoided with appropriate senior doctor review (e.g. consultant / SpR)
 Is this normal?

                              <span>Hi, I am a JCF started Urology themed CST in August. I have reading about the bad situation in ST3 interviews. My first question is how many people get interviews for let&#x27;s say 60 Uro ST3 to understand the competition. Secondly, if you are appointable, what are the chances of actually getting a positive if you are totally flexible and be happy to work anywhere?
 Thankyou.

It&#x27;s on the 2002 contract and it looks like they&#x27;ve got a good allowance of 80:20 clinical to non-clinical time and general reviews so far are good. I can&#x27;t access the juniordoctors website (it&#x27;s broken at the moment) so would appreciate any reviews/tips/advice from here, thanks all

                              <span>Just wanted to make a point that as far as I am aware hasn&#x27;t been made yet. The government are saying we&#x27;re being greedy asking for as much as we are. You tell the average person on the street that we need a &gt;30% increase (restoration) in pay and they may think this is ridiculous.
 Let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re an ST1 who works 42 hours pretty much 9-5 each week with 1 in 4 weekends. You&#x27;d currently earning roughly £50k before deductions.
 Let us assume that we get 30% pay restoration... Fab you&#x27;ve got an extra £15k.. Well no.
 - You get taxed 40% 
 - 9% goes to student finance
 - 2% goes to national insurance
 That £15k pay increase is actually £7350
 That means that after the government takes their cut that 30% is closer 14.7%

 So I’m currently halfway through med school and am now starting to think about picking a specialty (spurred on by looking at the specialty application competition ratios and realising that I need to start thinking about these asap to build a decent enough portfolio to guarantee my place in any of them). 
 I’m not someone who’s ever been driven by intense passion but have been involved in several wet lab and dry lab research projects (across a variety of fields) before and throughout medical school. I’ve also always been very interested in neuroscience (having taken this as my intercalated degree). Not inte…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone. 
 I need advice re my first error as a doctor. 
 Close to the end of my shift, a nurse approached me and my colleague to prescribe pain meds to a patient in triage. I took the cascard and looked at triage notes which said patient had taken X painkiller 2 hours ago and is allergic to Y and Z pain killers. I said, that limits my options as to what I can give. My colleague, who is more experienced, said prescribe C painkiller. I asked the nurse if the patient was allergic to it or if there were any contraindications, nurse said no. I prescribed it and asked her to double check with patient before giving it. (I did not know the allergy box on the cascard was not signed). 
 I finished my shift and went home. Later that day the sho that was with me called me to inform me that the patient had stridor after the medication was given and became unconscious. Medical team were called who gave her adrenaline and prophylactic intubation and ITU. The patient’s vitals were normal throughout. The patient’s partner was called who said the same incident happened to her with the same medication a few months prior. An incident form was filled out. 
 The next day the patient was extubated. Imaging normal and she self discharged. 
 The nurses are saying that they informed the patient of the name of the medication before giving it to her and she accepted it (have not witnessed this myself though)
 I’m glad the patient is alive and well and I’ve spent many days going over what I should and should not have done and how I could have prevented this. Currently I’m extremely worried about what could happen and what the investigation can lead to. 
 No one has emailed me yet about the incident report. Should I add it to form r
 Can anyone please advise.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi everyone! Just wanted to ask for some survival tips for surgery/ortho as an F2. I haven’t had a surgical job in F1 and feel like I will be overwhelmed when having to do nights/take referrals (if that’s something I will need to do)… Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello!
 I will start my F1 in August, and my first rotation will be in colorectal surgery at a decently sized DGH. Fortunately, my trust is very supportive; they offer a 2-week paid training before starting, and they assured me it will help me a lot in getting accustomed to being an F1. However, I&#x27;m still very worried as I really don&#x27;t know what to expect. 
 Do you have any tips? I&#x27;m particularly scared of on-calls...
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Can anyone advise me on the accepted practise re putting someone down as a referee for multiple JCF jobs? Would you ask them prior to each job you apply for or would it be acceptable to put them down for multiple applications if they have agreed once? Because trac jobs are asking for three years’ worth of references, I have to include a reference for a job I did over 18 months ago, and I feel so bad asking repeatedly for references but also have had a bad experience where I used a consultant twice for a reference and they emailed saying they only agreed to be a referee once (not the current consultant, this was from an F1 job). Is it the case with JCF jobs that they only send out reference requests once they have short listed you / interviewed you (if this is the case then I can give the consultants a heads up closer to the time). If anyone who’s applying currently / anyone who’s a consultant who’s getting reference requests could give me input advice, please it would be really appreciated, thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello all,
 Just a quick one here I&#x27;m hoping to run past the hivemind.
 I&#x27;ve been asked to design a helpful resource for my department, which in essence allows one to quickly identify what products are allowed to use for a specific category of patients, and what products aren&#x27;t.
 To me, this sounds like a QIP? I&#x27;m hoping for CST - this won&#x27;t really have 2 cycles as it just involves me designing a 2 page resource after going through some data.
 Is this still useful for specialty applications? Thank you, my friends.

                              <span>Currently a medical student on placement at a centre that is nation-leading in its field. Most of the registrars here I’ve met seem to be on the CESR pathway, the benefits of which seems obvious (no rotating, even better if a desirable location, not having to beat ridiculous odds to get a NTN etc). 
 However I’ve also heard that since it doesn’t have the recognition that a CCT does globally, most people with CESR have little to no prospects of emigration once it’s finished. How true is this and are then any countries/royal college equivalents abroad that do recognise it?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Just wondering if anyone could help me with regards to completing the Form R Part B, I’ve checked online and it’s still not clear to me.
 I’m a F2 trainee that will be starting GP training this August. There are a few forms that need completing on the TIS self service website, including Form R (part a and b). I’ve done Part a, now need to complete part b. 
 With regards to Section 1: doctor’s details
 1) Deanery/ Local HEE team:
  
is this my CURRENT deanery as an F2 trainee? Or my FUTURE deanery as a GP trainee?
 
if the answer is: FUTURE deanery as a GP Trainee, then for Previous Designated Body for Revalidation: is this my CURRENT deanery as a F2 trainee! 
 
 2) Current revalidation date:
  
is this the date of my ARCP in my CURRENT deanery as a F2 trainee (3/6/24)? 
  
3) Programme/Training Specialty
  
is this my CURRENT training programme ie Foundation? Or my FUTURE training programme ie GP?
  
Thank you for your help, really appreciate it!

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m undertaking a project in my hospital and as part of it I am creating a new sensory room. 
 The room is going in an existing space and will remain a clinical environment for patient assessment. 
 I wanted to put a dimmer switch on it. A gentleman came from the estates company that own the hospital and said that in order to install a dimmer switch it would need to be approved/paid for as it would constitute a &quot;change of use&quot; of the room. 
 When the hospital is returned to its owner in 2044, if the original specification we had when we agreed to take it on is different to when we return it then the hospital will be fined. 
 Any ideas how to get around this?

                              <span>I recently secured a job as a clinical fellow in palliative medicine at a hospice. It was quite challenging to find a job in the NHS these days, so I&#x27;m glad to have this opportunity. However, I&#x27;m concerned that this job may not be considered hospital experience and could impact my application for a residency program in the US. I&#x27;m unsure if I should decline the offer and continue waiting for NHS jobs. Any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Strikes are inherently political - there is no getting around this; we are in negotiations with a political party. 
 The conservatives fear publicity and love playing negotiations in private. They especially fear any publicity in the run up to the election. 
 With the significant losses in local elections now is the time to apply pressure. Already there is rumours of political schisms within the party to oust rishi sunak and pay us off; now we need to capitalise on these divides. 
 The only two acceptable solutions to us in current negotiations: A full 35% rise immediately (which will never happen) or a commitment to restoring 35% over several years which they cannot offer.
 We will never get as good an offer while not striking, and calling off strikes is just what Sunak wants. Don’t play into their hands. 
 We need to strike hard for the next 6 months until the conservatives have no option but to pay us off to get rid of the doctor problem.

                              <span>If you go to the GMC website page on how they spend our registration money, absolute 0% of it is for the benefit of doctors. In fact 100% of it is going to fight doctors. So if the GMC is there to protect the public from doctors, shouldn&#x27;t the public fund it? Why are we empowering those people?
 Should we do something about this?

                              <span>Hello, I’m a community nurse.
 I received an email that our April rota needs to be finalised by management by Tuesday next week. Problem is, it’s not been finalised yet, and Monday is a bank holiday, so no management. My manager resigned, so we have a matron watching over who’s slow to approve things. And she’s been off sick half this week.
 My colleague said we won’t get paid?

                              <span>I started an attachment 2 days back in a children’s hospital in Pediatric orthopedic surgery . Feeling kinda overwhelmed and lost on what to do here exactly. I am attending the rounds in the morning and shadowing Junior doctors and learning what they do around. Also observing some cannulations, blood samplings and catheterisations. And attending the clinics in the afternoon. But I don’t know. Im just having thoughts if thats enough to make the best use of it. Thoughts please ? Also my field of interest is surgery. Basically general surgery but couldn’t really manage to get an attachment in that department.

                              <span>I have a question about the dynamics of referrals within hospitals.
 I have a friend who presented to A&amp;E with worsening chest pain &amp; palpitations after their renal consultant advised them to present to A&amp;E if they ever got worse.
 Background of sharply declining CKD5 and a small pericardial effusion discovered during transplant workup echo.
 After 13 hour wait to see a doctor in A&amp;E overnight, then many more hours in the department they decided they would consult renal &amp; maybe cardiology. A few hours later they were admitted to AMU.
 Still on the AMU this morning they spoke to their renal consultant, based at that hospital, by phone and found that nobody had consulted renal at all at any point. The renal consultant has now paged a registrar to get involved.
 Talking about this in our CKD patients support group chat it seems some variant of this story, a lack or delay of referral is a fairly common experience. One person even had to involve his local MP to get his care and subsequent transplant process moving again.
 Is this just bad luck? Or is there a systemic issue that prevents these types of referrals from happening promptly? I&#x27;m imagining some poor medical SHO that&#x27;s got 500 million jobs to do and has been shouted out for making referrals too keenly before.

                              <span>I posted a couple weeks ago and thank you for all the advice however it’s still a problem for me. I’m autistic and agoraphobic and had a traumatic experience last time, I’ve needed a blood test for over a year now but cannot get down to my surgery to have it done. However my doctor is refusing to refer me to the community nurse because I’m not 100% housebound, surely at this point a year later they can see that I can’t cope with going in? I’m at my wits end and just don’t know what to do

                              <span>Hello,.
 So I had an Abdominal Hysterectomy 4.5 weeks ago with 8 inch incision.
 Seems to be healing lovely, save for a tiny scab/old dry blood section. 
 I did a bit of research regarding incision care , looking only at NHS websites. Most of them recommend using Vaseline a couple of weeks after surgery give or take, to keep incision area moist - as moisture is important for healing. Any medical truth in that? Apparently it prevents scabbing and encourages healing.
 However, I phoned my hospital (Spire) and their advice is not to do that, as it&#x27;s better to scab over (good indication of healing), and it&#x27;d better not to touch thr incision full stop.
 Would ne inserestting to hear views from different nurses or surgeons...

Aren&#x27;t smear tests done to detect cancer? I don&#x27;t know what STD she got but probably gonorrhea I think... (Writing it on her behalf cause she wants to know about it too)

                              <span>Recently, despite reassuring investigations on the NHS, I&#x27;ve seen a few patients pay a lot of money for private further investigations which always seem to throw up some minor incidental finding which they are informed needs urgent further investigation.. 
 The patients I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t seem to be particularly wealthy and they are typically are highly anxious. 
 Sometimes they are unable to afford further private care and are dismayed that the NHS won&#x27;t do the further investigations in the time frame they feel is needed.
 I feel they are being exploited. However, I am somewhat reluctant to say this directly to the patient as I am worried it would put them off seeking care and they are well within their rights to seek private treatment. I know how poor NHS care can be but in these cases they&#x27;ve all had good timely sensible investigations that are reassuring.
 Do you tell your patients if you think a private provider is taking advantage?

                              <span>I am due to rotate to my practice come August and was gathering some information. 
 My practice informed me that “they expect their trainees to be in 8-6”
 I’m FT which means I’ll be doing 4 x 10hr days, 1 x 5hrs then I get the 4hrs of self study. This is 49hrs/week. 
 Is this usual ?

                              <span>Title says it. Apart from annoying Group 1 status and hospital setting for GUM, what’s the difference in the day to day working life of CSRH and GUM doctors? Are the patient populations different? Are complex HIV patients ever managed in the community? thanks in advance :))

                              <span>I was chatting to a few doctors I work with recently, and I mentioned something about my payslip. Of a group of around 5, nobody had ever looked at their payslip. I was surprised because how do people just assume the hospital pays them properly? I’ve definitely picked up errors on mine before.
 Anyone have that mentality of never checking your payslip? Why? I would recommend it if you don’t currently.

                              <span>Hi there everyone. I am a British national and trained in London in Internal Medicine. The thing is that at the moment (and for the foreseeable future), I reside outside of the UK for family reasons. I got to know that previously, you could sign a contract with locum agencies, and they would get you locum shifts on the days of your visiting the UK. Now, I am hearing that the GMC has altered the rules, and now doctors have to work at least one week per month throughout the whole year to maintain their license to practice inside the UK. I totally understand that the GMC does have requirements for doctors to maintain their licence to practice in the UK, including demonstrating regular clinical practice and continuing professional development. But I would really appreciate if anyone could point out the exact rules regarding how many days/weeks one needs to work in the UK to maintain their ability to work as a doctor under the GMC.
 Any help would be appreciated, thanks

 I’ve seen many artful letters beating around the bush of someone’s obesity.

They say I&#x27;ve got to take annual leave for it. I emailed back saying unfortunately I didn&#x27;t want to disclose till I was further along but it&#x27;s an antenatal appointment and that I won&#x27;t have to take annual leave for it. They agree to grant leave.
 Unfortunately now the rota coordinator has now put my antenatal appointment on the main rota for everyone to see labelled antenatal appointment. I do not want to disclose my pregnancy to colleagues yet as it&#x27;s still early on and haven&#x27;t told family. 
 The incompetence of these people to disclose personal information 🫠

 Junior doctors in NI have declared two x 48hrs strikes
 22nd - 24th May 6th - 7th June
 No progression on talks and seeming unwillingness to negotiate
 Northern Ireland’s Health Minister Robin Swann has stepped down, essentially leaving Northern Ireland’s Health department without a Head
 Bit of a shift in argument, BMA have moved from “we should earn the same as Doctors in England” to “we demand full pay restoration”
 Credit where credit is due!

                              <span>Can anyone offer any guidance on unpaid leave - would I have the pay deducted for the how much I would earn on the specific days I miss (nights on call vs normal day) or would it be as a flat percentage of my entire income regardless of what those days were? 
 I’ve simply gone over my allocated annual leave this year and want to take a couple weeks off before next year. 
 Thank you ❤️

                              <span>Hi. I was on post nights zero day on last Good Friday, which was a bank holiday. So as per junior doctors contract and BMA policy, I should get an additional day off in lieu for that bank holiday. I emailed medical staffing and rota co ordinator about it to get a day off in lieu so i can attend an interview, but they have been ignoring my email. Who can the issue be escalated to?

                              <span>I an Emergency doctor, and I have seen this practice in the UK where we start IV fluids ( sometimes in a big amount ) for most patients with AF, unless they are clinically overloaded, as a method of rate control alone, and even in the overloaded subset of patients, IV fluids would be given but cautiously. I have tried in the past to challenge this practice as I believe that the main treatment for the stable rapid AF in the ED is rate control and try to search for the underlying cause, and I would only administer IV fluids if the patient is septic or dehydrated, otherwise, I don&#x27;t see any benefit from overloading a possibly tired heart with more load to deal with in a euvolemic patient. Unfortunately I have always been put down when I tried asking about how IV fluids alone would benefit these patients. I am not sure on the validity of this practice snd I thought I might be on the wrong side so I have tried to seek its justification but couldn&#x27;t find sufficient evidence. I also found this practice very common in a lot of EDs in the UK.
 Does any one have any insight on this practice being correct or not?

                              <span>In my 2 years of having been a doctor and 6 years of being a med student, I don’t think you get any kind of exposure to pathology unless you go out of your way to organize a taster or are lucky to have a placement in pathology 
 I have had teaching in FY from various specialties including IR, anaesthetics and even public health promoting their specialties and how their specialty is the best specialty but so far haven’t had even one pathology related teaching session. It’s a very alien specialty to most doctors who will very likely not have any exposure to histopathology in any form at any point in their career and probably has the steepest learning curve of any medical specialty given there is absolutely zero exposure to this specialty except tasters or extremely rarely foundation jobs/med school experience 
 Is there a reason there is not even a single teaching session related to histopath in FY years? Is it because it doesn’t look clinically relevant to our immediate jobs as FYs?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know what to do anymore. I&#x27;ve thought this to death and I&#x27;m going absolutely mad.
 ...
 I&#x27;m GPST1. Only done my hospital year. I didn&#x27;t get into IMT last year so decided to do GP and re apply.
 I have an offer. I&#x27;m considering switching to IMT.
 I have a group 2 speciality in mind (oncology).
 Except... have zero experience in it (currently trying to get taster).
 So, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll love it. It sounds fascinating to me otherwise and the job otherwise seems great.
 There are other specialities I like (gastro, resp) but the jobs are intense and I don&#x27;t know how much reserve I have left. I want more work life.
 I&#x27;ve thought about clinical genetics or chemical pathology which you can enter after GPST3. No experience in it either. But it&#x27;s 9-5, and not GP.
 Other times I think maybe I should do something like anaesthetics or interventional radiology. Very procedural, much less fluff.
 My options are, do IMT 1&amp;2 at 70% LTFT over 3 years to give time to finish full MRCP / PACES.
 Or, finish 2 more years of GP and do 2 years of IMT full time, and do MRCP / PACES in 4 years time, and maybe get some papers under my belt (or switch to a different speciality... I could prepare for that).
 I just worry that with every year, the competition ratios seem to go up exponentially, what if there&#x27;s no chance in 2 years...
 My head hurts.

 Dear colleague,
 We are continuing talks with government officials about a credible offer for 2023/24. These talks seem, at present, positive. If a credible offer is received, we will be putting that out to you, our members, for a vote.
 With a general election around the corner and a DDRB recommendation for 24/25 expected in the summer, our priority is to get the best possible offer for 23/24 as an important step in building a base for our journey to full pay restoration. This decision is rooted in a pragmatic assessment of the current political landscape with a government whose lifespan may be less than a year. If/when the landscape changes, priorities for an incoming government with at least five years to govern will undoubtedly be different and we will be ready …</span>

                              <span>Hi guys, Massive insomniac and just don’t know what to do as an incoming F1. Sometimes I can go 2/3 days without sleeping but I feel like a zombie - and whilst it was okay as a medical student, I dont want to make errors and I note that the z drugs cause significant brain fog.
 With that in mind, I was wondering if anyone had any experiences or advice? I know some suggest using melatonin but I find that doesn’t really work - does anyone have thoughts or experiences using Daridorexant or Lemborexant (Dayvigo)?
 Or if not, what can I do? 
 Thank you

                              <span>Family friend is a GP partner. Their practice is releasing their PA due to very poor clinical performance, but more than that, the impact of this case has been extremely significant:
 https://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/analysis/gmc-case-in-focus/gmc-case-in-focus-how-gps-should-supervise-pas/
 In essence, this is precedent which mandates that every single clinical case now must be re-examined by a GP, meaning they cannot see patients (quite rightly so IMO). This GP also reckons that a lot of surgeries (Cheshire) will follow suit very quickly; alongside the BMA guidance, there is simply no scope nor appetite to continue employing PAs. Their role in primary care is legally indefensible in a GMC tribunal.
 I suspect over time, only PAs will be seen in secondary care.

                              <span>I saw this video from Good Morning Britain about a nurse who was nearly killed by strangulation by a mental health patient.
 They mention a few things in the video, about dissatisfaction with waiting times being one of the reasons patients are getting angry, a society shift in attitudes and lack of respect since the pandemic. They also mention about nursing staff having to wear body cameras in A&amp;E.
 As a GP I see the occasional dissatisfied patient and verbal threat but never any physical violence. Is this happening to doctors as well in hospital settings?

                              <span>I’ve already started maternity leave and baby due any time, I’m not eligible for OMP but government website says I should get SMP. My employer said I’m not eligible for this but still haven’t clarified why or given me an SMP1 form. I thought they were legally obliged to have this sorted well before my mat leave and provide SMP1 within a week of declining my SMP. I have been chasing this up for well over a month now! Other than regularly calling them and emailing anything else I should do to escalate? So stressful not knowing how much I’ll be paid and when. Another joy of NHS where I’m just being fobbed off from one department to another and being told it’s not their job

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just need some advice re: upcoming ARCP 
 Struggling to meet teaching requirements for the year. it has been so hard to attend teaching most weeks
 as per 2023 decision aid, need to document: 50 hours teaching attendance to include minimum of 20 hours IM teaching recognised for CPD points or organised/ approved by HEE local office or deanery. 
 anyone know what they mean by &quot;IM teaching&quot;, since I&#x27;ve attend very little local teaching. even with IMT clinical day I still don&#x27;t reach 20 hours. any way I can make it up before ARCP date? do e-modules with CPD points count as part of 20 hours IM training? 
 Thanks a lot!

 He tried to remove it in front of my eyes today, so I put it back.
 Me: no, leave it there.
 Him: you can put it in a drawer over there.
 Me: I&#x27;m not putting it in a drawer.
 Him: it&#x27;s 10 steps away.
 Consultant: it&#x27;s out of the way as it is...
 Him: it is dangerous to have it near electronic devices!
 Me: I&#x27;m keeping it here unless you can show me a written policy saying I can&#x27;t have a water bottle.
 Him: do you have a medical note saying you need it?
 Me: no because that&#x27;s ridiculous. Show me the written policy.
 Him: FINE! EVERYONE CAN HAVE THEIR BOTTLES NOW!!! storms off
 Spoiler: there was no policy.

 I think that euthanasia is very likely to be brought in under the next government. I wonder how the BMA stance works practically in eg. Specialities such as psychiatry where as part of an assessment you may deem someone has capacity to make the decision to end their life. Would you then be obligated to offer signposting? I am thinking about how this will change the dynamics of conversations. 
 Does anyone else wonder how, if euthanasia is legalised, it will affect the dynamics of the conversations they have with their patients?

 What’s the secure bike storage situation like?
 Where I’ve been previously they’ve had secure lockups accessible by code.
 Would be nice to be able to take a semi nice bike without fear of it getting nicked. 
 Does anyone also go to Regent’s Park before work in summer to get laps in?

 It does not appear to be associated with oriel/Trac but does say requested by HEE. It just has a slightly unofficial look about it.
 Has everyone received this? Am I being scammed?

                              <span>With a new batch of doctors starting specialty training later this year, I was hoping to hear of any success stories of doctors that have managed to get their educational supervisors to agree to accelerated training (so e.g. In paeds you could technically get your 7 year program completed in 4 years). 
 I&#x27;m specifically interested in paeds trainees stories, but want to hear how others convinced their ES to accelerate the sign off? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>My training job will have a big chunk of its rotations at the QE, and I live in a 50 minute drive from the hospital (or just over an hour by train door to door). I don’t mind the commute time itself since most of the drive is countryside, but how’s the parking situation etc?

                              <span>What?
 We need to take action against the General Medical Council and their anti-doctor agenda. By endorsing MAP expansion, they are undermining the medical profession and risking patient safety. However, unregistered medical practice is illegal, and unless the BMA coordinates a campaign, we must continue to pay GMC registration fees. 
 The GMC encourages doctors to pay registration fees by direct debit. Direct debits have the lowest admin burden for the GMC and low transaction fees. 
 Essentially, if you pay via direct debit, the GMC keeps more of your money and has to spend less on processing the payment.
 However, the GMC allows you to pay your registration fee by other methods:
  
Credit/debit card
 Cheque
 Postal order
  
https://preview.redd.it/v6niyr3k8zxc1.png?width&#x3D;1596&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;7041dc4cf411d8967c4901c072371d9f1af2b7c4
 So what?
 These other payment methods will cost the GMC more to process and administer. 
 Card payments are associated with higher payment processing fees. Cheques and postal orders will require more administrative staff to manage and process them.
 Mass cancellation of direct debits would send a message to GMC management, and may force them to acknowledge the strength of feeling amongst the medical profession.
 However, you would need to remember to pay via these other methods - one advantage of direct debits is that they are automated.
 Now what?
 We&#x27;re open to any suggestions you have about this idea. This would require a coordinated campaign to raise awareness and encourage doctors to switch their GMC payment method.
 We have considered alternative options, but withholding GMC fees is only feasible if the BMA backs a campaign and provides protection for doctors. The GMC removes doctors who do not pay fees from the medical register, so you won&#x27;t be able to work. They&#x27;ll also inform the police if you continue to practise medicine!

 Was wondering if anyone had any advice for teaching fellow interviews e.g. what sort of questions come up and how to best prepare.
 Many thanks!

                              <span>We all know how brutal it is during changeover as an F1, and twice this year the F1s I’m with have burst into tears. I certainly did so myself in their position. I make them a cup of tea and chat through things, but has anyone got any other ideas for how to support F1s in this situation? Did someone do something that made you feel much better that you can share with us?

I get them coffee but don’t buy anything for myself because I already had coffee and my stomach would thank me with GERD. Consultant looks disappointed and says that there is no such thing as too much coffee. I prefer chai which I make myself at home but sometimes will have coffee

                              <span>Hi all, Just needed some advice with regards to accrued annual leave during maternity leave.
 I am due to start maternity leave in the next 10 weeks or so (I am an FY1), unfortunately in my second rotation I wasn’t signed off due to absences related to hyperemesis and my final rotation I will end up going on maternity leave a month before the rotation ends so will need to repeat this rotation too when I am back.
 I have been in contact with my foundation program coordinator to query about adding my accrued annual leave during maternity leave to the end of my maternity leave, however she said this was a employment query so I contacted medical staffing at my hospital. 
 Medical staffing said I had to contact my line manager (again confused but was told this would be rota coordinators for each department ). I am very confused as I do not know what rotations I will be returning to as I cannot ask my scheduled f2 rotations rota coordinator about taking accrued annual leave as I still have 2 Fy1 rotations to repeat
 I have explained this to medical staffing multiple times in emails but no one seems to understand and keep telling me to go to the foundation school. 
 The foundation school keep referring me back to medical staffing as annual leave is an ‘employment issue’ and not something they would address.
 I am really confused on what my next steps are and how to actually contact someone about my accrued annual leave, 
 Need to sort out housing and location for maternity leave and knowing whether I can take those accrued days would be very useful but have been back and forth emailing for weeks without a proper response.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated

                              <span>Hi,
 Incoming FY1 - recently passed finals -&gt; yay!
 Im thinking of upgrading my current stethoscope - standard littmann III classic for 3 reasons:
  
I find it hard to hear even in quiet environments
 I have a cardio job in my rotations
 and treat yourself don&#x27;t beat yourself
  
My questions -&gt; is it worth upgrading to a littmann IV cardio or even getting one with an amplifier?
 if anyone has either of above, your opinion would be appreciated.
 cheers

                              <span>As the title suggests failed the SCA in April, the next one I can book is in September 2024! Was due to CCT in August. How does it work now? Surely there will be so many people in my situation. Is RCGP just going to keep handing out extensions? Final ARCP at end of this month and few bits and pieces left so not entirely sure if I would be even able to focus on the exam in June if I can get a date. Reckon lots of people eyeing June so not even sure if a place will come up.

                              <span>Hi,
 I just received my SCA result (first attempt) and failed it by 0.5. I’m quite surprised by the case breakdown.. I passed some cases I was sure to fail and vice versa.. However, I know this in particular happens very often, so I’m particularly bothered by that.
 Anyone with experience with appealing the result? Is it worth the effort and hope? Anyone heard of success stories? Or should I give up and accept it and move on?

 How do you manage his AF?
 Do you anticoagulate? Given he has a reversible cause…

 I did the adult and child safeguarding level 3 certificates in ST1 and thus in ST2 they want you to show an annual knowledge update, but I don’t have any ideas

                              <span>Heyy guys I’m moving to Liverpool in September from Ireland and I’m a qualified healthcare assistant and phlebotomist. Also an ambulance technician over here. 
 However, I’ll be studying paramedic science full time so bank contracts would probably be ideal for me. Could anyone tell me how these work as I’m not familiar with them at all and is anyone here working bank for the NHS? Particularly in Liverpool?
 Thanks so much😁

                              <span>What I want to know is how legal is this? 
 I&#x27;ve been having private paid therapy and my gp surgery phoned her up and told her to no longer see take my appointments as I&#x27;m refusing treatment from the NHS and my mental state isn&#x27;t healthy. 
 Me and the therapist have sorted things out but I have obviously switched surgeries. 
 The whole thing is baffling honestly and it feels like I&#x27;ve triggered a narcissist in some way. 
 She was so offended I didn&#x27;t want her help that she tried slandering me over the phone with my privately paid therapist. 
 My question is did she have the right to do this and interfere? If I contacted her therapist and said don&#x27;t see her anymore she refused me a prescription wouldn&#x27;t it be the same thing?

                              <span>Hi,
 A PA who didn’t introduce herself as a PA phoned me yesterday to ask me questions about my current health. The only question she asked was “how are you feeling?” as I prefer seeing private professionals, I replied “fine”.
 I checked my records and I see that she has coded questions and answers which she never asked and completely made up the answers.
 I called my NHS GP practice to let them know that my medical records had been updated with gibberish and that I wanted a correction.
 They got the same PA to call me and she said she “made a mistake” and that she “used her best clinical judgment” to fill in answers based on my saying I was “fine”. She answered questions about my levels of anxiety with completely made up answers even though I am seeing a private therapist for these anxiety problems.
 I said to her on the phone I was not happy with her cavalier attitude regarding my medical records and that this couldn’t be a “mistake” since she knowingly filled my record with bs data. That’s when she said I should stop being condescending towards her…
 I must say I am pretty shocked following this encounter, she apologised for making a “mistake” and that she “understood my frustration” she actually asked me the questions she had taken upon herself to answer in my stead and surprise surprise, her “clinical judgment” was a mile off my actual answers.
 Is this normal/ok? I always thought medical records were critical and confidential. Are PAs even allowed to access them? Are they really allowed to feed the system bs data they have made up with no patient input?
 This is in England. Thank you for your replies 🙏🏻

                              <span>Hi guys, i have a question, my partner had a surgery for herniated disk 4-5 years ago, after a couple of tries she became pregnant, now she is 7 months already and couple of days ago we went to talk with the doctor about c section surgery. She looked over her info and she told us your partner is going to have normal delivery, no c-section, is she allowed to do that ? My partner doctor, the guy who operated her for hernia told her after surgery, you can’t have a normal delivery cause you have another hernia which is not for surgery yet, what are we supposed to do now ? If something is going wrong she will take the blame ?

                              <span>I work in MH services and my probation has been extended by 3 months.
 During my 3 month probation review I had made a big mistake (but took accountability and learned from it!) and it was highlighted I didn’t always engage with other staff as well as I could of, alongside making inappropriate jokes.
 I accepted this and was more mindful however I then learnt one of my coworkers took a dislike to me which really affected me, my MH and my ability to do my job. I spoke to management and this was smoothed over.
 My 6 month probation I failed and the same things were highlighted although I shared I felt this was unfair due to making improvements. 
 I had lots of positive feedback however the same issues were still present (apparently) although I was never advised of this and was never told about this.
 I was told this would be extended 3 months and my matron said that it’s fine and she wants to support me the best she can and will do everything to help me alongside start sending emails with any concerns or difficulties so there is a paper trail they can show HR to show I’m doing well. They also said it was going to be extended 6 weeks however it’s now going to be 3 months as it protects the trust from being accused of unfair dismissal.
 My concerns are has this been extended as they wish to fire me? MH is so subjective and it really depends on who is manager that day! They’ve dated it so I’m only on probation 10 weeks but I’m absolutely terrified I’m going to lose my job! 
 Has anyone else had this happen?

                              <span>My MRI is happening next Friday and I understand results can take a while, and mine is just an extra precaution and not as high priority (incidental lesion find at fracture clinic but no -looking aggressive features.) 
 From what the appointment letter tells me it sounds like the MRI will go back to the referring doctor, does that mean they’ll arrange an appointment at the fracture clinic I went to originally to discuss?
 Just asking because I live across the street from my fracture clinic but the MRI is further afield.
 Tangent but if no one knows that’s fine: I was a regular blood donor but last request text received, I asked before making an appointment given I’m being screened for this and on the waiting list for another (also precautionary due to recent familial diagnoses, not personal symptoms) and they deferred me for now. 
 If after these screenings the doctors say I’m all clear can I just email the Blood Transfusion Services and let them know I can donate again? Or is that like a permanent deferral.

                              <span>I’m in England. I spoke with my GP practice (with a lady whose role is a health professional access role). I checked my medical records and I can see that this same lady has coded entries for questions she never asked and answers I never gave. Isn’t this falsification of my medical records? How can I report this and have my medical records updated to remove these confabulatory entries?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have an interview for an Appointment Coordinator on Friday and although the job description explains everything that I will be doing, I am still somehow confused. 
 I believe I will be booking, changing and cancelling appointments.. which is fine. But I’m currently working in a call centre for a bank and I absolutely despise it. So I’m quite nervous at the thought of this job being similar to my current one. I really don’t want to be stuck on calls all day speaking to people. I don’t enjoy it!!! 
 So any input would be appreciated. Would it be like working in a call centre or would it be more relaxed? I’m just so confused and I was excited for the interview but the more I read the job description, my excitement fades. I’m trying to get out of call centre work and I’m starting to think this job is a call only job the more I read into it. 
 I attached a few points from the Job Description above. Thank you :)

                              <span>Just wanted to get people&#x27;s take on a situation such as this: 
 I got bleeped by a number that I recognised as being one of the main wards I work on, and I called back straight away (like 10 seconds between the bleep and me calling). 
 It just kept ringing and no one picked up, so I left it for a bit. 
 5 mins later i get a bleep from the same number, and again I called back straight away, and again no one picked up.
 Since it was two consecutive bleeps from the same number I worried it was something urgent, so I called the ward back on a different number which I know is also one of the extensions on that ward. The nurse answered and I explained that I had multiple bleeps from a different extension but I&#x27;m calling here as no one was answering the other phone.

                              <span>Hi there, 
 This post isn’t really about me but rather my girlfriend and my relationship. I am not a medic, so my knowledge on this topic is very limited. That’s why I have decided to reach out to you for advice. 
 Little Background information:
 I have just completed my 3rd year in Dentistry in Scotland. My girlfriend whom I’ve met at uni is just completing her first Foundation Year down in England. I am trying to find out about her career options, in order to figure out how we can end up living and working in the same place again. We both have EU passports if that is of any help. 
 I am completely new to this, and that is why I have a lot of questions. I will appreciate any help and advice. 
 What are the career options for medics straight out of foundation year program? 
 How does one enter specialty training after completing FYP? What are the requirements? Do you have to complete Medical core training first? Can you pick the place you want to do your specialty training or are you allocated to it randomly? Can you start your specialty training in one city and finish it in a different one? Should you go into specialty training straight after finishing FYP or is it better to gain some experience working first? 
 Working abroad:
 What are common destinations for medics to work abroad, having finished medicine in UK? Where in EU is it possible for UK doctors to work? If you want to complete specialty training in EU or move forward with your medical career, do you have to speak the national language, or are there countries where you will just be fine with English? I am aware lots of medics end up moving to Australia. What does enrolling into specialty training programme for a UK do it or look like in Australia? Is it feasible? 
 I am aware it’s a lot of questions, but I would be grateful for any help!

                              <span>Hi, was hoping that someone here would be able to give me some advice/guidance.
 I&#x27;m a final year medical student due to start working as an FY1 doctor in July/August this year. I unfortunately didn&#x27;t get the region/group that I wanted within my deanery, but had been coming to terms with this (my partner and friends all got their top choice region).
 Whilst contacting one of the trust administrators for a different issue, they advised me that one of my rotations within my FY1 year has changed (to a less desired one for me), and also that my job is a GP LIFT programme, where I will have to work a day a week in a local GP practice.
 The LIFT aspect wasn&#x27;t advertised anywhere in the ranking process or individual job description; when I told them this, they told me that the individual programme code (being FPP instead of the standard code) indicated this despite it not being mentioned that this was the case anywhere, nor was there any other evidence of this elsewhere. 
 I don&#x27;t particularly want to do the LIFT aspect and would much rather do the normal programme as it was advertised to me. Overall the randomised job allocation process has affected me quite negatively and now this is just another aspect which feels completely out of my control. 
 I&#x27;ve contacted the BMA about this but they advised me that my trust is acting as mandated per my deanery, and that because the deanery is not directly an NHS employer they are not obligated by law to engage with the BMA; therefore the BMA cannot help me with this. 
 Is there anything I can do about this? If so, how should I go about doing it? Any advice would be much appreciated as I&#x27;ve found this whole process quite overwhelming and I&#x27;m not sure where to go from here. Thank you.

                              <span>As the title suggests I’m not in a good place at the moment. I am on my last F1 rotation and still feel like I’m drowning each day I go in to work. I’ve taken a month off and being treated for anxiety and depression. I’ve spoken to my supervisors and they have not been very supportive. My clinical was very flippant and made me feel less than. 
 No one seems to understand how difficult I find adjusting to new rotations every four months and how only having my first medical job now - psych, surgery, medicine - means I feel grossly underprepared and under confident compared to my colleagues. On this new rotation I’m expected to see my own patients on ward round and there are no reg’s to ask advice. I understand how this may be realistic for approaching the end of F1 but I feel I’ve drawn the short straw having never seen medical patients independently until now. So I spend the whole day doubting my decisions and when I get home I’m usually tearful or just numb. I don’t have any friends or colleagues in F1 to talk to I am so alone. 
 As F2 approaches I do not feel ready - part of me is relieved at my ARCP likely being extended due to illness and not meeting portfolio requirements. I think about alternative careers every single day as I have not enjoyed one day of F1. But I feel like a failure contemplating leaving what I’ve worked so long for. It’s to the point where I’m having frequent passive thoughts of ending my own life.
 I’ve had advice to continue and pursue a career in psychiatry - which I am interested in but the thought of another year of hospital medicine is daunting. 
 Has anyone felt like this and kept going? Any experience with mental health and ARCP being extended? Should I leave now? Any other advice at all would be appreciated

 A patient was referred to me as priority, I sadly misdiagnosed her and got worse. 
 After our appointment weeks later, the young lady visited a&amp;e and tests were done. a mix up with tests meant we received a false report about her health and nfa was required. 
 Understandably, upon discovery of her misdiagnosis at a later date a complaint was made against myself and another Dr. 
 The response from the hospital, wasn&#x27;t in her words &quot;Good enough&quot; and she made comments about GMC. 
 This event has left me sad and stressed with my performance and how it may cause issue in her future care. 
 Would GMC contact me directly, if she complains to them. Would I be wise to contact them first.

We have the exact same first and last name and have both applied and went for interview. I&#x27;m very anxious that that might be the case and my offer would be withdrawn and given to that other person, as I know the other person has actually a better portfolio. Is it possible for the recruitment team to withdraw my offer at this point of time? I have already been asked to fill in preferences and apply for certificate of sponsorship

                              <span>The more PAs I work with, the more I realise they are some of the most condescending group of people I’ve met. 
 There was a PA student in my department recently who was shadowing doctors. I was explaining an ACS diagnosis to a patient so she came with me. I won’t lie I wasn’t over the moon about having a PA student but all the other doctors were engaging and I didn’t want to stick out like a rude sore thumb. The patient obviously had a load of questions about UA and her future risk of further ACS episodes. Rather than observing how I, the doctor, approached these questions and translated the medical explanation into laypeople’s terms, the PA student jumped in to answer the questions herself, clearly regurgitating definitions from a textbook without the communication skills doctors are tau…</span>

                              <span>I came across this article comparing MP pay with JD pay. So from 2008 to 2024, an MP&#x27;s salary increased by 49.9%; for JDs, from 2008 to 2023, the percentage change in salary was 14.59%.
 Now I know that a part of it is a supply and demand issue. You cannot bring MPs from outside the UK, but you can bring doctors from outside the UK. Obviously, all professions cannot get the same salary rise, but can any Econ nerds out there explain
 1) What other factors led to the consistent rise in the MP salary?
 2) I would have thought that the MPs, being a public service profession, the same pay review body reviews the pay and therefore should&#x27;ve been closer to the doctors pay? Is that not the case or does the MP profession have a higher shortage?
 3) Can there be a new post called MP associate to reduce the number of MPs and therefore cut down the taxpayer spending on MP salary?
 Thanks

                              <span>Recently sat an ALS course for the second time. All the faculty except one were Nurses/Paramedics and all seemed to be semi retired. 
 Lots of very clear gaps in their knowledge about how ALS is done, particularly in hospitals. 
 ALS is meant to be advanced, and I would argue if you have faculty and candidates that don&#x27;t understand the very basics of blood gasses or the management of hyperkalaemia that they should be teaching pre-hospital courses or ILS, not &#x27;A&#x27;LS
 Is this just me? Was I just on a bad course?

Unfortunately I suffer from terrible migraines and had one today. So I called in sick today. Now I feel terrible, because I just had my RTW done yesterday. 
 Will I get into trouble, I&#x27;m very scared

                              <span>This is an extremely niche question that I couldn&#x27;t find the answer to online.
 I re-applied for specialty training to move regions but not specialty. I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to get an offer in my first choice region. One thing I wasn&#x27;t so sure about is what I needed to do after accepting the offer. I have already let both my current and my future TPD know about the offer.
 Do I need to do anything else? Do I have to formally resign from your old training number?

 For FY2 GP jobs, roughly when do you find out your practice? Given no out of hours commitments, am I right in (possibly optimistically) thinking you can take all of your 9 days of annual leave in one go?

 Ward clerks proceeds to open toilet door and scream as they catch me with my pants down and bits in the open. Cue a thousand apologies and excuses about how I forgot to lock the door.
 How do I go about the rest of the rotation avoiding the ward clerk/pretending this did not happen. 😭

                              <span>Whenever I talk to family and friends about the worsening job market for doctors in the UK I&#x27;m met with genuine disbelief and told &#x27;they wouldn&#x27;t let that happen&#x27;. 
 It&#x27;s tiring explaining the whole situation of increasing competition for even what used to be poorly filled specialty training places, a saturated market for clinical fellowships, less locum opportunities, MAPs adding to the problem etc etc
 Are there are resources or data to show: - number of doctors who are facing unemployment ie number of qualified doctors not in post of whatever flavour contract - change in number of monthly locum shifts per Trust
 People keep asking why this isn&#x27;t in the news. I realise reddit isn&#x27;t a reliable data source and want to have some independent statistics to back it up. 
 I&#x27;ve looked on the NHS digital website but it mainly shows the latest stats of numbers of doctors currently in employment.
 Any recommendations on resources?

                              <span>Hi folks! Is there anyone who has successfully transferred to NI from England? Im just wondering how feasible that is given NI has a small deanery in the diagnostic specialties.

                              <span>Hi all. I’m a GP ST3 in London, thinking about pursuing training in chemical pathology alongside working as a part time GP. Got a few questions in mind re work as a chem path registrar. Any chem path trainees I can get in touch with?

                              <span>Hi all, FY2 here - earlier this year I received a rejection for my ST1 O&amp;G application (Shortlist unsuccessful) and so I applied to some clinical fellow jobs. I got a message the day after saying:
  
Application Status changed to &quot;Shortlist unsuccessful&quot; from &quot;Longlisted&quot;.
  
Today I&#x27;ve received an email saying:
  
we are now pleased to let you know that you invited to attend ST1 O&amp;G interviews on either 23rd or 24th May
  
(yes they missed some words there)
 It&#x27;s from Oriel so I know the message is not a scam but I know Oriel can be a bit weird/poorly managed so is this actually legit, i.e. something that can happen? My dashboard still says &quot;Shortlist unsuccessful&quot; though.
 Trying to hold off being prematurely happy because I don&#x27;t want to be disappointed! And what could have led to this change? I got a score of 521 if that helps.
 Thank you for any help.

                              <span>Hey guys, I’m an Australian citizen and I’ve lived in Europe my entire life due to family reasons. I recently moved to UK and currently working in surgery as Trust Grade Doctor at ST1/2 level.
 I’m looking to reconstructive surgery in the future and am just wondering if anyone has any advice regarding training in plastics. Is it better here or there? Where do I have a better chance of getting into training?
 What’s better in terms of salary and work-life balance?
 Thanks 🙏

 I feel like I&#x27;m missing out on so much by working here. I can&#x27;t go to friends weddings (even after submitting leave requests 6 months in advance) due to staffing. Can&#x27;t get study leave for a course for the same reasons even after a request for cover from my ES. The rota coordinator and everyone else I need to interact with on an admin side either feels incompetent or malicious. It just feels like everything I try to do gets denied and there&#x27;s no point in even trying anymore, they might as well allocate my leave for me. I genuinely don&#x27;t know what they get paid for other than saying computer says no.
 I don&#x27;t have a job lined up for next year, didn&#x27;t want to have to go straight into specialty training but don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve got in anyway. Every med ed post or JCF that I&#x27;ve applied to I&#x27;ve been rejected from without even a chance at interview because so many people with MRCP/MRCS are applying.
 I genuinely love being a doctor when I get to do my job and I don&#x27;t even care about the pay anymore. I just want to feel the tiniest bit valued or respected instead of used and abused. I can&#x27;t leave the country or move easily as I have a partner that is stuck in their job for the next 2 years and I just don&#x27;t know where the light at the end of the tunnel is.
 Is there any way that I&#x27;ve missed to try to get my leave approved? Or can they just keep rejecting everything that I submit.
 Any fun or hopefully stories would be very much appreciated and sorry again for the rant.

                              <span>Let’s say you have only two choices: middle of nowhere in the UK and middle of nowhere in Australia. You do not have any family or roots in either country and you are a FY2 or similar grade in the UK who didn’t get into training and are now planning FY3 
 Personally I am leaning towards Australia because at least there is some incentive there as I hear NSW and Sydney salaries tend to be lower than more remote areas but in the UK there is no such incentive. However Australia is really humongous and I worry if there is the possibility of ending up 6 hours away from a city let alone a major city (not very well versed with Australian geography myself)
 Only talking about remote areas. Not that I will rank remote areas above cities but that competition is fierce and jobs in remote places are easier to get in both countries

 I&#x27;ve explained I have orthostatic hypotension secondary to a medication so standing on a hot ward without water leads to me fainting but he says it&#x27;s policy.
 I&#x27;m so dizzy and frustrated. Is this normal??

                              <span>Hi all, current FY3. I&#x27;ll be leaving medicine at the end of the year for a non-clinical job and I&#x27;d like to maintain my license to practice. Wondering if anyone is able to help with the following:
  
I know there are no set requirements for appraisal/revalidation but do you guys reckon 1 shift a month is sufficient to maintain my license?
 
Say you don&#x27;t pass an appraisal one year - what happens? Do you just get told you need more evidence for the appraisal?
 
In terms of restoring a license to practice, I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s a lengthy and more difficult process?
 
 Basically just any advice would be much appreciated, I&#x27;ve tried asking around and reading online but bit confused on what happens if you&#x27;re taking multiple years out. Thanks for your help :)

                              <span>As title says. They have been the most unorganised and unhelpful foundation school. The FTPD, foundation school admin and Foundation programme leads have made my whole experience of being off sick from work and going LTFT a nightmare. Wont go into more details as its quite specific and don&#x27;t want to potentially identify myself.
 Who is above the FTPD to complain to?

                              <span>Looking at it from my perspective, neurosurgery is usually only in the big tertiary centres, and they always seem to be inundated with referrals and emergency cases, but for some reason there are limited training posts and even more limited new consultant posts. 
 In the big tertiary centres I’ve worked in, neurosurgery can always be found cracking out emergencies day and night. Surely it can’t be good to have brain abscesses and bleeds waiting for hours and hours when they’re Cat 1 cases? 
 Is it that there’s no funding for more consultant posts or are the current consultants ladder pulling because there’s so little private work to corner? Just speculating here sorry. 
 I know we all moan when referring to neurosurgery as you’ve got an ill patient with intracranial pathology who may or may not need intervention, but the poor neuro reg is filtering referrals from all these other DGHs in between cracking open craniums. All the while the non neurosurgeons are sat waiting for a decision for sometimes hours.

 AITA for being a bit put off? Is this where medical interviews are going? Am I wrong for wanting to be interviewed by doctors for a doctor post?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I am in the midst of ranking the standalone FY2 rotations and I needed some advice. 
  
Is there a place where I can find feedback about foundation schools, like we can find out about CT/ST programmes? 
 
How intense are general practice rotations? I would like to keep hectic rotations for maybe later in the year when I&#x27;m more settled in. 
 
How does the ranking and matching system work exactly? If I don&#x27;t get my first choice programme, do they instead give me my second choice or do they just skip to the next person? 
 
 Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I feel although necessary, so much talk is been wasted on the PAs. In my opinion the real doctor replacement role in the UK is ACPs and not PAs but I don&#x27;t know why everyone is so afraid and shying away from saying this. I heard a consultant tell a trainee acp in the midst of doctors that when she qualifies that there is nothing a doctor can do that she won&#x27;t be able to do legally except signing death certificates, that it would even change soon.😳😳
 So dear doctors, the only thing that makes you and I different from ACPS is that we can sign death certificates and cremation forms
 An ACP can pick up doctor locums as well as nurse/pharmacy, OT, physio locums as the case may be. Why are we not pretending like ACP is not a better thing to be instead of a non consultant doctor. Why are we not talking about the major threats to our profession, PA is a minor threat but ACP is a major threat.

                              <span>Would really appreciate some advice on this please. I am a medic applying for a group 1 specialty and would like to go LTFT (80%) for specialty training for mental health reasons. 
 Without going into too much detail, I have done all of my training so far full time, but the last couple of years of IMT were a real struggle and whilst I managed to finish without any sick leave, I was very close to not being alive at multiple points. My IMT TPD was not really aware of any of this - there were some wellbeing concerns raised at one point but they were put down to other issues, and I think most colleagues would be very surprised if they found out about my diagnosis (and just to be very clear, there have never been any concerns about me clinically and my MSFs/WPBAs have always been very good). I am doing better now and have good support in place, however, because of how bad things got during IMT, and because the nature of my illness means I am likely to get unwell again, I really want to work LTFT in order to try and have some breathing space should things start to go south again. 
 My question is, how much of the above should I disclose to my TPD when discussing my LTFT application? Should I tell them my diagnosis and how bad things got? I really want to make the most of HST because I missed out on loads of opportunities during IMT because of my mental health, and if there is support they can give such as allowing me to go LTFT, I really want to make the most of it, but equally, I don&#x27;t want people to be prejudiced because of my diagnosis. Or even worse, not believing me because I have managed to work full time so far (I can provide evidence of my issues though as I have letter from Practitioner Health etc.). 
 I would be grateful for some advice regarding this from anyone who has been through something similar (or from anyone consultants who have been on the other end).

                              <span>Well…can’t believe I am now posting vents on this sub…but here it goes, I’m an IMT, out following the outreach reg reviewing patients. There was a patient who was referred to us on non-rebreath and in deteriorating T1RF. The bay only had 1 oximetry. The nurse assistant was doing her obs round at the time. While I was reviewing the patient with the reg, I asked the NA if I can borrow the machine. The NA told me to get my hands off the machine and I am not allowed to use the machine. At the moment, I couldn’t be asked to care about what she was saying. So I apologised to her and explained that this was a critically unwell patient (no pun intended). Then I took the machine to attend the patient. After our review, the charge nurse had a go at me… essentially chastising me for being condescending to the NA. She also threatened to notify my ES. After years of service in the NHS, passing exams, playing the portfolio game, it frustrates me to say this…but I dislike where we are as modern day doctors.

                              <span>I had double vision Jan 2023 so went to get eyes checked. All fine. Suggested MRI scan. 
 Had MRI scan 6th March 2023.
 Dr appointment July 31st - any news from scan? Nope oh look we have not sent it, they send it. 
 10 days later call from doc saying Nero ppl deem it as urgent - 28 week waiting time for urgent - &#x27;small white specs on brain scan found&#x27;. 
 It&#x27;s almost been a full 9 months since 10th Aug 2023. 
 Whatever is happening in my brain I&#x27;m getting random headaches and weird feeling and it&#x27;s really starting to affect my day to day life and I am self employed.
 I&#x27;ve messaged doctors but nothing. PALS said talk to docs. Receptionist said to talk to people who asked for scan (eye people) ...
 I don&#x27;t know how to proceed with my health getting worse but not knowing what it is.
 Hard to explain and so worried and anxious but annoyed as whatever it is affecting function day to day. Any advice or similar experience welcome 🙏 please and thank you Peace and love

                              <span>Last night I had a funny turn, some slight heart issues and loss off consciousness, 2 paramedics from Bournemouth arrived and I immediately felt like I was in safe hands, they were funny, light hearted and put me at ease and has made a significant impact on my views of the NHS despite the bad press in recent years. This was the first time I had taken an ambulance and they totally made me feel at ease. As well as them being slightly older than me they offered some personal advice and said I was their nicest patient that week which again made me feel awesome! 
 The doctors at Bournemouth despite being insanely busy do incredible jobs so I would like to thank those as well! 
 Keep up the good work guys, you are truly appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been waiting on neurology for months but while under another department we&#x27;ve discovered an issue.
 Both of them clash in regards to what we&#x27;re trying to work out/fix.
 Do I cancel one appointment and do the other,or go to both?
 Context: Neurology wants to see me as it was originally physc but orthopaedics has discovered a possible organic reason within the last 2 weeks.

                              <span>I am currently specializing in EMDR therapy for complex trauma patients. Additionally, I am pursuing an advanced diploma in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with a focus on individuals with OCD. 
 My passion lies in supporting postnatal women, as I believe there is insufficient mental health support for them, and many suffer silently. My personal experience led me to this path, and I’ve known many women endure similar struggles in silence due to fear of being institutionalised or having their children taken away.
 I find myself torn between the NHS and the private sector. My husband tells me not to bother. He says the amount of red tape and bureaucracy within the NHS will take away from helping anyone. I have put a lot of effort in my education and have worked in another medical system, so I take this extremely seriously. I currently hold a MSc. 
 I am looking for your thoughts and opinions on working within the NHS, specifically in mental health.

                              <span>How many hoops do you have to go through and what is career progression in general like for nurses. 
 If I went into nursing I would want to look into policy changes and impacting care across a trust. I like the idea of putting more psychology into nursing practice - I could see myself impacting resources and maybe doing a ClinDPsy or something as well incorporating clinical psychology into nursing and change things on a big scale. 
 Is there much opportunity for projects and leadership opportunities in mental health trusts?

                              <span>I am increasingly concerned at how recruitment is handled within the NHS trac as a system is not the most user friendly to begin with. 
 But add to it the fact that checks either take so long you want to smash your laptop/phone screen and I really do question why I keep putting myself through the stress.
 For context I worked in the private sector for 15+ years, then after covid hit decided to join the family business (wife is an occupational therapist, mother in law is a nurse). So my first experience of the NHS was the bizzare system that is trac!!
 Having worked in recruitment for so long I find it extremly bizzare that this is the system they have stuck with. Whoever is in charge of that decision needs to try and apply for any jobs on trac and understand how uninspirational, buggy and …</span>

 Many websites offer similar tests but I don&#x27;t trust them, but since this is offered by the NHS and apparently the results don&#x27;t confuse the impacts of the vaccine with the impacts of the virus, I have some level of confidence in it.
 Question is, do any of you here know if these tests are actually reliable?

The first one I tried to register with (I am in its catchment area and they’re taking new patients) said that they can’t take me because I’m at university and can’t go to any other GP than that one. Is this really true? I have uni friends at that GP though I suppose it’s because they were there since before they went to university?

                              <span>I think I have chips in two teeth. What is the cheapest way to get the best treatment?
 So three teeth have become sensitive and there’s definitely a tiny chip in one of them, and seems like cracked enamel on the other two. I generally take really good care of my teeth but I tend to drink a lot of acids and I haven’t been to the dentist in almost a year now. 
 I’m poor at the moment and I’m a student. I’m also wary that not all dentists are reliable. I’ve looked around at private prices and they vary (a lot of them ask for deposits for initial assessments and then assessment fees so it would cost £150-£250 just to get them looked at and probably another £150 to £400 to get them treated.
 I’m concerned about it tbh because it’s getting a bit sensitive over the past couple of weeks. I really don’t have much money too.
 So what is the best way to get them treated for the most reasonable price but highest quality and fastest service in London? I’d appreciate tips

 How is it possible to rank jobs when we don&#x27;t know what nearly half of them are?
 Also, there are jobs listed on oriel which aren&#x27;t in the spreadsheet sent out. Have contacted HEE but come on....someone please make it make sense.

My 2 rotations are gynae and obs (QEUH) and A&amp;E (GRI) I was wondering if it is a good idea to go less than full time? As I have been told we get less pay, less days off, and also are rest days are taken away. And at the end you have to return all this time anyways. Now I am wondering if it is worth going LTFT or not. Only deal breaker for me would be, if people working full time are getting more rest days than I am, and have more AL. So eventually no difference between my hours and their&#x27;s

                              <span>I have worked (clinical attachment) with 2 consultants in 2 different hospitals and they are both happy with my skills. Would it be beneficial for me to ask them if they can create any FY2 spots for me with a rotation at their clinic? Is that doable? I feel JCF is out of my reach yet. Any input appreciated.

                              <span>Earlier on in medical school, a completely false allegation was made against me to the police of impropriety. I was voluntarily interviewed under caution. A while later the investigation was closed with no further action, I was never arrested or charged.
 I&#x27;m now in the process of applying for registration with the GMC, and found out this is something I&#x27;m obliged to disclose to them. I am seeking legal advice.
 I hadn&#x27;t considered this incident in a while. In hindsight, I feel as if the university didn&#x27;t properly investigate me, I just got a few offers of support and nothing really ever came of my disclosure. This was an extremely stressful time of my life, I was just happy at the time that the university were not hounding me. I&#x27;m now concerned that I didn&#x27;t contact exactly the right people or inform them of precisely the right things. I&#x27;m worried that this will result in me being withheld registration so that I can be investigated.
 I informed my university of the fact that I was the subject of a police investigation and was to be interviewed at the time. I did this via my tutor and university welfare team, and clearly stated I was a medical student, I have evidence of this. However, I didn&#x27;t specify what I was being accused of, and was never asked. I have some limited evidence that I informed my tutor that I was specifically being interviewed under caution, but it&#x27;s not airtight.
 I was just hoping for people&#x27;s views on: 1) If I should have been more explicit/ done anything differently informing my university at the time and 2) how likely I am to be withheld registration.
 Thank you for your opinions in advance.

                              <span>Hi! I’m a F1, hoping to apply for anaesthetics later this year. Having been working on my portfolio to show commitment to speciality. I was in theatre recently shadowing an anaesthetist who told me he keeps a logbook for all his cases for appraisal purposes. This got me wondering if there’s any benefit in starting a logbook for all the cases I take part in? For example, I have I inserted a decent number of Igels so far. Hoping to get more experience in airway management. Has anyone ever done this? If so, which logbook did they use? Sorry if this is completely unnecessary, given the competition these days, gotta do whatever is possible.

 Also any advice/opinions from those already training there? Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I recently passed finals and will be starting F1 in August.
 I was unlucky with UKFPs random allocation and was given one of my bottom choice deaneries (not Northern Ireland before someone asks 😅) 
 I was given my ~150th job choice, and to be honest, I don’t really mind the job rotations themselves, they’re just a mix of general medicine and surgery.
 My concern however, is that I’ve been allocated to small DGHs for both F1 and F2.
 I want to do Ophthalmology which is hyper-competitive (another user posted today and the 2024 competition ratio was something like 16:1…)
 The trust I’m in doesn’t have its own Ophthalm department apart and everything is referred to the nearest largest city.
 Your Ophthalm portfolio counts a lot for your speciality application (50% of your entire score, 20% MSRA and 30% interview)
 The criteria they want is also very niche and specific and you really need to work closely with a good ophthalm department to get everything ticked off.
 I’ll have to network like crazy and cold-call ophthalmologists and beg them for projects, but I’m really dubious about how effective this would be.
 Like imagine you’re a consultant ophthalmologist - how likely would you be to respond to a foundation trainee you’ve never met before who isn’t even a part of your trust asking to do projects with you?
 Any advice on how to approach consultants and get my foot in the door would be hugely appreciated. 
 Also any advice on how to juggle working full time but also factoring time spent commuting to the nearest ophthalm department in your free time.
 I’ve already decided I’m taking an F3 for portfolio building!
 Thank you :)

                              <span>Throwaway account as my friends now my real one.
 Hi! I&#x27;m an IMG about to finish my F2 year. I recently accepted a GP training post starting in August. I&#x27;m very grateful to get into training, especially considering the tight competition for SHO posts.
 However, even though I&#x27;ve accepted the post, I&#x27;m still considering moving to Australia. Since I&#x27;m from Asia, Australia is definitely closer than the UK, making it easier to travel home for emergencies.
 The only thing holding me back is the requirement to work in a non-training post for over a year before applying for Australian training programs, as I understand PR is necessary. Additionally, I&#x27;m unsure about the competitiveness of getting into GP or IMT in Australia.
 Therefore, I&#x27;m debating whether to commit to the GP training program for the next three years until CCT before moving to Australia.
 I&#x27;d love to hear from people who have recently moved to Australia post-CCT or after FY2 for their insights. Thank you very much!
 Edit for additional info:
 The reason I chose GP training here in the UK is because it was the shortest route to CCT. But I&#x27;m actually unsure if I want to become a GP. Does anyone know if getting into IMT is super difficult for IMGs in Australia?

 The competition ratio for this year&#x27;s ST1 ophthalmology intake appears to have risen to 16 applications per post. Here&#x27;s how the ratio&#x27;s increased since COVID-19:
 2018 - 4:1
 2019 - 3:1
 2020 - 6:1
 2021 - 7:1
 2022 - 9:1
 2023 - 10:1
 2024 - 16:1
 Well done to all who got in this year!

                              <span>GP trainee. On a hospital job. Asked for day of study leave to sit AKT in 3 months&#x27; time. 
 Declined by rota coordinator due to staffing level on that day. No one is able to swap with me. 
 BMA guidance suggests this counts as study leave rather than professional leave. 
 PGMDE support portal doesn&#x27;t say anything specifically about study leave for the exam itself. 
 The study leave policy for my Lead Employer Trust does not seem to be helpful and just generally states that study leave is discretionary and dependent on safe service delivery. 
 Any advice please? Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m a junior trainee in ICU right now. I&#x27;ve had some wellbeing issues raised from others (mainly they can see my mood is low/I catastrophise when anything goes wrong or I feel like I&#x27;ve done a bad job). They&#x27;ve spoke to my supervisor who has spoken to me and I&#x27;m going through CBT for this and regularly checking in with my supervisor who has been very supportive. 
 I found out from my supervisor (they knew this already but didn&#x27;t mention anything till I mentioned the issues, think they were waiting till I was in a better headspace maybe) one senior trainee raised patient safety concerns. My supervisor agreed I should speak to the senior trainee to get a better idea of what happened. I think these were mainly related to a couple procedures a month or two ago in which they asked if they could take over as I&#x27;d tried for a while and things weren&#x27;t working - I said I wanted the usual one more go for around maybe a minute or so then accepted defeat. The main reason I was hesitant was I didn&#x27;t want to look incapable and handing it over meant that would go down as a failure. No harm came to the patients as far as I know anyway. I spoke to the senior trainee today but they just said I should speak again to my supervisor and said their main focus was patient safety. Made me feel like crap for sure as I&#x27;d hate to be unsafe and always have this fear. Prior to this never had any issues like this raised.
 I&#x27;ll speak to my supervisor again and see about more details. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has advice about managing this, how to get over this feeling of worry and I guess that concern about feeling safe- there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any concern from my supervisor and I&#x27;m still on rota working independently etc if this makes a difference. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>It would be great if we could get a good representation of doctors to respond to this consultation.
 To me it seems like a load of Tory election manifesto talking points, and transphobic dog whistles. In my time working for the NHS, I don’t think I’ve ever had any patient give two fucks about the biological sex of another patient across the bay? Due to the bed pressures we have plenty of mixed bays now anyway. 
 Half of all patients spend about two days in random corridors before getting a inpatient bed, so I’m also not sure how they’re going to ensure every member of the public walking down the corridor is of the same biological sex as each patient stuck there.

                              <span>The way medicine is headed in the UK currently, with increasing numbers of med school placements and worsening training bottlenecks, more and more of us are going to end up having to work a few years in JCF/SCF roles before entering into training. 
 In England, this means that we have to take a knock in our salary to enter training, which I think is kind of ridiculous. Clinical experience (no matter what specialty) makes us better clinicians and more well-rounded doctors, and I don&#x27;t think anyone should be penalized for that. It&#x27;s wild to me that if a consultant decides to retrain in another specialty, they have to drop down to an ST1 salary. There is no other career that requires its professionals to decrease their salaries in order to train. 
 Is pay protection something we should be pushing for? Is the BMA looking into this? Obviously FPR is priority and the training bottlenecks need to be fixed, but I feel like this is also kind of important?

 Let me know if anyone is interested, preferred mode of communication would be whatsapp or discord etc. Its going to be a 4 month grind and we all would have to work as well so consistency a little bit everyday is key. I am from gmt +5:30 timezone but any timezone is okay for me .

                              <span>I’m an incoming FY1 and the MDU came to our med school to encourage us to sign up recently. I have heard there are alternatives to the MDU though with different benefits. Please could anyone give me their advice regarding which defence organisation to sign up to? 
 For example, an ITU reg told me that the MDU only defends you if you are currently paying subscription fees. Other providers apparently defend you based on if you were a member at the time the incident occurred. This has meant some retired consultants have to continue to pay the MDU after they stop working in fear of a former patient trying to sue them years down the line. Is this true? Are there any other things we ought to consider? 
 Many thanks in advance for your collective wisdom!

 All the doctors pause and think, PA is the one with the answers. 
 Are they geniuses, just (over?)confident, or are we/I the dumb ones?

                              <span>Hello everyone. I am a foreign student and will be starting my F1 at Aintree hospital in Liverpool this August. My first rotation is in Respiratory Medicine. Do you have any advice for what I need to expect, and what I need to prepare on or is it more of a &quot;You will learn on the job&quot; sort of situation. Also, I need to find an apartment or room to stay in for the duration of my training. Are there any websites or something of that sort for me to find any listings?

 Bit of a financial dumbass. What would the ST4 Salary be after pay increments so far for specialties like cardiology, respiratory etc?

                              <span>I’m a final-year medical student, starting F1 in August. In my last few weeks of placement, I’ve started wearing a bit of makeup in the hospital. 
 When I say makeup, I just mean some basic foundation, mascara, bit of blush, bit of eyeshadow, nothing particularly striking. Basically what I would put on if I was going out for a meal with friends or maybe an informal date. However, what has been striking is the very noticeable difference in how I’m treated. I’m always keen and try to be enthusiastic, so normally after a couple of days of turning up for things the docs will be relatively nice and friendly to me, but it’s definitely only after ‘proving’ myself. Totally fair enough, they get lots of med students passing through. By contrast, I feel like I’ve been treated better and felt welcomed from the get-go. Not many concrete differences that I could point to, mainly just warmer tone and body language, although one of the docs even offered to talk me through a procedure rather than me having to ask. 
 Now, I’d love to believe that everyone is just a bit nicer here, but realistically I know I look prettier with a bit of makeup and let’s be honest, pretty privilege is real and it seems like it’s at least a contributing factor to being treated differently. Anyone else experienced this whilst working? I know it varies significantly from team to team as so whether most people wear makeup or not - what’s the standard practice in your department? 
 I don’t really desire to wear makeup every day but if it means I’m likely to be treated that much better as an F1 then I think I’ll have to…

                              <span>Mods, I couldn’t see a rule explicitly against this but please feel free to delete :) 
 I wanted to say a big thank you to the registrar I had an appointment with yesterday. He was interested in what I had to say, engaging, and took my concerns seriously. I have a complex medical history so time constraints around clinic slots are always on my mind. By the end of my appointment, we had a plan and I was whisked off for further tests. He also gently challenged me and we had a discussion around the process of behaviour change. 
 I work in the NHS in community mental health so I know how pressured everyone is. I wanted to express my gratitude because so much clinical responsibility falls on your shoulders. I follow this sub because we often have student doctors visiting and have psychiatry trainees; I really enjoy working with them and want to have an appreciation of how difficult things are. I try making sure they’re invited to all the staff nights out, meals, and shepherd them out the door if they’re working as late as me. 
 Anyway, a big thank you for all you do. It hasn’t gone unnoticed! ❤️❤️❤️

                              <span>I have got a new job in Hastings. My wife is working in Hammersmith, London. We are planning to move to some place which is feasible for both of us commute wise. Sevenoaks ( somewhere near to the train station) is one of the places we are considering. Can my fellow Redditors please shed some light on Sevenoaks or suggest some other places as well ? 
 Only cons of Sevenoaks I think is that her commute ( train+tube ) would be somewhat around £550 per month 
 Some key facts: I have a car and I drive. My wife doesn’t drive. She uses trains/tubes/busses. She occasionally works night shifts as well. I want her commute to be as short as possible and willing to drive upto 80 mins each side to&amp;from my world place 
 All input highly appreciated, thanks

 I feel stereotypes help build a good rough framework upon which more nuance is learnt.
 So...can we list some barn door surgical referrals you might receive/give?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just hoping to get some guidance on the above. If I work a bank shift, and get paid via a separate payroll number for all related bank shifts, is this not classified as a second job? If yes, would I then not have to make SLC repayments on that payslip and only my full-time salary? Thanks for your help.

For the first time in history, our profession faces the threat of gross unemployment. Medicine was previously seen as a career that guaranteed job security. Now at every level, from foundation training to core training, through to HST, this is no longer a reality.
 Locum posts are drying up while simultaneously, core training posts and higher specialty training post numbers are too small to accommodate the rising number of doctors looking to fill these positions. I believe these bottlenecks are being created deliberately to keep d…</span>

What do you do if you are writing your supporting statement and do not meet the desirable criteria?
 
Should you write up the attributes (education, experience…) first or a little paragraph about the values of the trust etc..
 
If a person spec has alooot (and i mean a lot) of knowledge and skills criteria should you mention them all?
 
 Any other advice would be appreciated :)

                              <span>Hola, 
 I&#x27;m currently a band 2 clinic receptionist and have got two interviews for band 3 positions. One being associate clinical coder and one being admin support typist. The support typist role would be an upgrade within my current department and the clinical coding is a complete sidetrack. I&#x27;m confident enough in my science to deal with the clinical coding job as I&#x27;ve also done it on the side in my current role. Admin support typists in theory would be a lot more chill but the progression would be gated to gathering experience and then applying for band 4 roles over just progressing naturally from acc to cc and getting a band up. For anyone that has been in this position (or anyone in general) what would you say is the better option?

I’m supposed to get my general bloodwork done as well as recheck my A1C (I was diagnosed as a prediabetic in January when my A1c was 5.7). Anyway, I’m wondering if I should hold off and if so, then for how long?

                              <span>Hi I read that in Scotland dental care is on the NHS till 26 years old now. Does anyone know if this applies to getting braces? (NON-cosmetic IOTN grade 4) Or has anyone gotten braces on the NHS over the age of 18? Im 21 now.
 Was strongly advised to get them by my dentist when I was younger but refused due to poor mental health.
 Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask.

                              <span>I previously worked for NHS England as a nurse ,took a career break and partially relocated to Scotland to be closer to family. My career break has ended and I have no intention of going back and I have secured a job in Scotland, with NHS 24 as clinical supervisor /Nurse Practitioner. currently waiting for HR to contact me for further discussion after job offer. Is it sensible to ask for relocation allowance? their website says this “A relocation package of up to a maximum of £8,000 is available to newly appointed staff who relocate to take up a position on a Band 5 or above. If they have relocated to live a reasonable commute to their new workplace, and this is considerably closer than their previous address, then they may be entitled to relocation expenses.”

                              <span>I’ve been going through some investigations recently with different departments and it seems every department uses a similar but different way of contacting me. Why is that, does it not cost more to have so much IT?
 For example- some communications come through the NHS app.
 Others come through this portal https://eastkent.nhsportal.net
 And others through this portal https://pp.ekhuft.nhs.uk/
 They’re both called the East Kent patient portal but have different letters and appointments from different departments and different accounts and logins to access them and it’s basically impossible to remember what is where…

 a pertinent example of my own insanity in active alcoholism was pretending that i had an un-diagnosed brain condition that explained a lot of my curious behaviour to my partner, friends and family. slurring my words? the brain thing. trouble sleeping? the brain thing. pissing the bed? the brain thing. losing the thread of conversations or forgetting stuff that had happened only minutes ago? the brain thing. you get the picture.

 My current manager this morning said i need to add my leaving date for my current job on ESR. This was news to me as ive never done that before when taking secondments. Looking at the leaving page on ESR it seems to be for people leaving the organisation.
 Ive asked a few other managers i know and they have said this is news to them too. I may need to check with HR but anyone that works in this field know the answer

Just had that call and they&#x27;ve diagnosed me with Diabetes, am I right to question whether diagnosing me over the phone was appropriate? I strongly believe it should&#x27;ve been a face to face appointment especially because i&#x27;m at work right now and have to pretend I didn&#x27;t just receive life changing news. Is this normal practice?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been sick for a few weeks, but I&#x27;ve been completely unable to get any sort of gp appointment. Eventually I dragged myself to the pharmacist and was prescribed antibiotics but I&#x27;ve been completely out of commission for weeks and I need a fit note for my course.
 I&#x27;ve tried getting a gp appointment however my practice has told me i won&#x27;t be able to get one for over a month unless it&#x27;s immediately life threatening. I&#x27;ve tried their website that says there&#x27;s a form but any time of day I go on it it says &quot;your practice is no longer taking requests, please try again tommorow&quot; 
 I cannot wait months for a backdated note, that&#x27;s kinda ridiculous, was wondering how else I&#x27;d go about this. I cant really afford 60 quid for a private appointment either.
 This is purely about my avenues to get a fit note, not advice on being ill or anything.

                              <span>Had a blood test done a week ago. It was requested by a hospital consultant and done at a walk-in blood centre at the local hospital. I’m wondering if the results will automatically go to my GP and be viewable on the NHS app, or would I need to call the consultant’s office to find out the results?

                              <span>I had an MRI scan of my brain a few years ago and I always wanted to see it but never did. I never had chance to ask and then it I just never got round to it. I wouldn’t know who or where to ask, or even if this is possible.
 Is this something I can do? If so, does anyone know how I could go about doing it?
 Not everyone has the chance to see their own brain so I’d love to see mine.
 Thank you!
 (My brain is all okay FYI)

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a diagnosed medical condition for which I receive treatment overseas. I&#x27;d like to continue this treatment in the UK. A GP confirmed that the medication I take is available here and can be prescribed by a specialist.
 Due to long NHS wait times, I&#x27;m considering a private consultation to get the medication sooner. My question is: if I obtain a private prescription, is there any way it can be converted to an NHS prescription while I wait for an NHS specialist appointment? 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Can anyone give any insight in to how these rules will actually be applied? For example - what would happen if a post op trans woman who had been on hormones for years was admitted to hospital, and there was no private room available?
 Will NHS staff check the records of those they ‘suspect’ to be trans when placing a bed for them? What if someone’s trans status is only discovered after they’ve placed in a single sex ward - will they have to be moved?

                              <span>Can anyone confirm if this is correct, I was off from 9th December 203 until 12th march 2024. Returned to work, my manager hadn’t added my absence to ESR. 
 So I got this shock on payday. I have tried to speak with payroll/HR and head of healthcare. Next stop is the union. 
 I am a band 5 for context, I realise they must of overpaid me by not stepping me down whilst off however they’ve given no warning or told me of this error only when I rang to query and they refused to pay me as usual but set up a payment plan to pay it back. 
 What I can’t understand is that I worked 6 weeks so why is my basic pay so low. Also should I put in a grievance as it has left me destitute.

                              <span>I’ve got an interview for a receptionist position at an NHS mental health centre. I applied as I’m studying counselling part time and thought it could be complementary.
 But is this the right choice? I’m wondering if I’m better off in an actual helping position (like care work or mental health support worker). 
 I’m wondering if the fact that the position is at a mental health centre is maybe here nor there? 
 I mean, I will be speaking to people who are distressed and gaining an understanding of the MH support system, which is useful. But I’m worried potential unis I apply for (to do a 2 year counselling diploma) may just view it as a receptionist position and not value the MH aspect. 
 My other worry is maybe I’m too qualified. I don’t mean to be arrogant, but I have a first class degree in another field and have been self employed as a writer for 4 years earning double what this position offers 😬
 Never worked for NHS or as a receptionist so would be grateful for any general opinions/advice!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a SW working bank and the department I&#x27;m working for does not add my bank shifts on e-roaster. I have to email all the time to remind them to put it up as they conveniently forget.
 We pick shifts up on a WhatsApp group but there have been times when bank staff came in the office at 8am and were sent home as they weren&#x27;t added on the &quot;paper rota&quot;. Rationale was that shift were not confirmed over email or e-roaster only in Whatsapp group.
 This is extremely frustrating and bank staff managers can&#x27;t do anything without an email confirmation but they are refusing to reply to emails confirming shifts.
 I&#x27;ve sent an email about my upcoming shift on the 1st of May that I&#x27;ve picked up over Whatsapp group, but haven&#x27;t heard back. 
 What should I do?
 What can I do to stop this abusive behavior?

                              <span>GPST1 here looking for guidance. I’m a IMG who’s been struggling with reflections mainly cause my ES dosent accept the usual reflections to account for numbers and extols the virtue of gaining a true learning for each reflection. Second reason is cuz my hospital rotations a too damn intensive. I’m quite low on numbers right now and just got the email that ARCP is due in May. 1) can I just write all my reflections in retrospect? 2) if I fail ARCP will I be thrown out of the program? 3) what happens if I fail ARCP? TIA

                              <span>FY1 here, probably going to have a central ARCP because lots of sick leave due to pregnancy and also took maternity leave Just filled out my mandatory learning log in one sitting- haven’t had time to fill this in as i went along due to wards being so busy.
 Im just curious if the “what was learned” part of the learning log gets checked or matters? I have written very vague one liners for each teaching session. Tbh if i have to go through each one and write a detailed summary of each teaching session i might have a breakdown 😭 already holding onto my sanity by a thread.

 Has anyone got any experience returning to a medical hospital job with a baby &lt;12 months? How was your experience balancing this?
 Have you had any exemptions from the on call rota/ what other accommodations have been made for you whilst breastfeeding? Not found many threads addressing this so was hoping to hear from others in a similar boat (GP trainee here but any trainees welcome to share their input!)
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>I posted last year asking for advice about a consultant groping me and I wanted to give an update in the hopes more people report this behaviour. I got advice about contacting the BMA but they weren&#x27;t helpful at all so I gave up. My trust referred the consultant to the GMC and I reported him to the police. I don&#x27;t want to doxx myself but the police enquiry wasn&#x27;t successful for a variety of reasons I can&#x27;t go into.
 The investigation with the GMC was very thorough and they took multiple statements from me. It was extremely scary going to the hearing (I gave evidence both virtually and in person) but the tribunal members were very respectful. They did ask some inappropriate questions but they just needed to clarify I did not behave in a way that warranted him to touch me. 
 He ended up getting erased from the medical register. I&#x27;ve not had any contact with him apart from the hearing and I&#x27;ll be moving to a different deanery at the end of F2 so will be able to put everything behind me.
 I&#x27;ve also been in therapy since the incident and have healed in lots of ways. I&#x27;ve spoken with a lot of colleagues and it is surprisingly common but very few doctors report it. I hope that if someone can relate then they will have some hope that the system can protect you. If anybody needs any advice or wants to know how the process works I am more than happy to have a chat.

                              <span>I am an IMG and I have been working in a psychiatry department for 6 months now. This is a non-training job. I would like to apply to core training in psychiatry but I need a signed crest form. My consultants are not sure if they can sign that form because of the 1st competency &quot;1.1 Clinical assessment Assess patient needs in a variety of clinical settings including acute, non-acute and community &quot; They are saying acute setting can only be in general hospitals. Is that true? Because of the current competition for nontraining junior jobs I couldn&#x27;t get an interview from general hospitals so far. Due to my experience and background I have been getting interviews for psychiatry jobs only. I started feeling stuck.

I have got training in internal medicine starting in August however I would like to do training on a global talent dependent visa(husband being main applicant) rather than on a health and care worker visa? Has anybody done this before and are they happy to share their experience? Much appreciated.

                              <span>Can someone explain how an RCEM credentialled ACP, who might only have been qualified as an ACP for 3 years and only have a PGDip on top of a regular BA, is equivalent to an EM ST3?
 An ST3 will have a minimum of 4 years postgraduate doctoring (often more), alongside MRCEM. How is that equivalent to an ACP with 3 years experience and no formal examinations?
 I&#x27;m out here, unable to get into EM training and also getting rejected from ITU CDFs yet my department are increasing the number of ACPs and I&#x27;m watching them get more training than they ever invest into me.
 The ACPs are lovely people but half of them can&#x27;t interpret an ABG and are not functioning at the level I&#x27;d expect from an FY1 in ED. The other half are very good at their jobs, but why are we training them instead of doctors? Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to have funded them going on a GEM course instead of their (really quite shit from the sounds of it) ACP course?
 It&#x27;s just very frustrating.

 I was hoping to understand if there’s scope of this being extended to a year? And is there scope of this even becoming a ST number after? 
 Decision to make as there are visa considerations and of course uprooting the family. Any advice or experience would be much appreciated.
 Thanks in advance ✌🏽

                              <span>Hi all! I’m currently awaiting to hear about an IDT. There were delays which pushed things back 2 weeks (after national recruitment offers coming out), and conditional round 1 offers were supposed to be released today. 
 Has anyone heard anything? Does hearing nothing mean I was unsuccessful and should just await round 2 opening on 7th May? Or do we think no one heard anything and things have been delayed again…
 I wish the IDT team would let applicants know either way, it’s torture waiting. The national recruitment process was tough enough, but this feels just as awful. Life completely on hold unable to focus on anything until we know the outcome.

                              <span>This is not a comment on whether there should be more training posts - ofc there should be. 
 Unfortunately due to the unlimited supply of IMGs from third world countries depts have the ability to kill the locum market with JCFs. Due to the strikes, locum budgets have been slashed. PAs and ACPs will ofc be used as replacements for doctors in all but name. 
 If you haven&#x27;t entered training, or already got a JCF lined up, the next year of unemployment (because that&#x27;s what a locum F3 is) will be scary. 
 Try to get on as many banks as possible and join locum agencies. Good luck guys. 
 In my opinion, it&#x27;s better to enter training in something you have 0 interest in and at least pay the bills than risk locumming. Of course there will be some work, but you may go weeks / months without any stable work. This will not be comfortable. 
 Our progression is so low. The F3 used to be a mini lucrative break that we&#x27;d get from the hell of foundation year, and now the current generation of foundation docs will lose out on that. Many of us used F2 to buy a home or pay for weddings. 
 It is now more important than ever to get FPR and to also become much more protectionist with our profession - stop training ACPs/PAs that just ultimately kill the locum and job market for us.

                              <span>Genuinely curious, why do we pay an annual fee to keep practising as doctors? I can’t imagine any other profession where you have to pay a fee to keep doing your job? Why have we not complained about this?

 I guess if it’s open to public then it should be fine but not sure if there are any repercussions if you know the person personally.

 Why is NHSE/HEE funding trusts to take on PAs? James Paget University Hospitals NHS FT were given 10k per PA and they employed 4 PAs then (see third pic). Source: https://www.jpaget.nhs.uk/media/530301/260221-Medical-Staffing.pdf
 Meanwhile, 99 newly graduated F1s “placeholders” will only find out where they will be sent to for 2yrs by the end of June. F1s do not even get a study leave budget, let alone £500.
 This extends to primary care as well, where PAs get one non-clinical session per week to ensure wellbeing while they abuse the F2/GPST/GPs. They get such a sweet deal! (See fourth pic).

                              <span>Hi all. Appear to be unsuccesful for a training post in the August 24 intake. Statistically is the Feb intake anymore likely? Assuming less applicants as it&#x27;s not straight after F2 and somewhat out of sync? Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m so fed up. Currently an F3. No specialty training place. Locums look set to dry up in August. Trust has put out a tonne of trust grades and have said in emails to not expect there to be much in the way of locums. I&#x27;m applying to everything, not even a shortlist spot so far. I&#x27;m stuck geographically due to family. I am the breadwinner. Just me. No partner with a second salary. Children to feed. I don&#x27;t know what to do. This situation needs to be on the news. Someone should try and count the numbers of unemployed doctors in August and it needs to be on the news. Sorry for rambling, I&#x27;m just so upset

                              <span>Current F1- always dreamed of being a GP, always been reassured that the country will always need GP’s in every town and village on this island. However now increasingly anxious hearing anecdotes of GP’s getting CCT and not even being able to get a job at the end. Thinking about alternative careers- but anxious that I won’t enjoy others as much as medicine, then it will be a pain to try and get back into training, especially if I don’t complete F2. I guess my question is, is the doom and gloom ahead worth looking for alternative careers? N.b. I do really enjoy working as a doctor, though the NHS is making that very difficult. Any advice muchly appreciated!

                              <span>I am F2 who is finishing in December hence out of sync. I have been asking around for JCF jobs at my place but they want an August start and unlikely to offer a December start as they already have received loads of applications for August so no posts will be available for December. I feel like being out of sync is putting me at a disadvantage. Is it possible to extend F2 until August 2025 so that I am not out of sync? I am doing very well and on track so can’t deliberately fail ARCP as they will probably catch on to this. The other option looks like Australia as I got in touch with an agent and they can give me start dates in December but I would like to avoid going just now as I am due ILR in 2 years in the UK anyways and feel settled here but if I am facing unemployment here than that leaves me no choice really but to go to Australia 
 Anyone else out of sync who could advise?

Only ever worked in England under 2016 T&amp;Cs so not sure how the contract works, even after looking it through. If you’ve worked as a trust grade does that count toward the pay progression nodes or not?

 I am a junior doctor on the wards and I have been wondering, how do you approach and manage coarse crackles on the chest bilaterally?
 I have seen ppl go with saline nebs, other with Carbocisteine TDS.
 Whats you take or advice please? 
 Thank you very much for all of your input!

                              <span>Hi all. F2 here due to move to Aus for F3 in September. With the way things are with increasing competition ratios etc in the UK, I&#x27;ve been looking at the possibility of trying to get into training in Aus and potentially returning as consultant in the future, if I can&#x27;t get onto training here. Is this realistic? I understand it&#x27;s difficult to get onto training abroad anyway as, unlike here, their native graduates are understandably prioritised. But say I did manage it, would the qualification be recognised here in the case I decided I did want to come back? I&#x27;m interested in psychiatry if that changes anything.
 TIA

                              <span>We want to raise the alarm about the GMC’s plans for Physician Associates and the new Medical Licensing Assessment (“UKMLA”).
 We believe the GMC is laying the groundwork to allow Physician Associates to take the MLA and join the medical register. This will likely occur under pressure from NHS England/DHSC after they realise the PA role is uneconomical as restrictions are placed on PA scope of practice.
 The GMC is aligning the new national assessment for PAs (the PARA) with the new UK medical licensing assessment, which medical students must take to join the medical register (PLAB is also becoming the MLA). 
 The new Physician Associate Registration Assessment (PARA)
 The Physician Associate Registration Assessment (PARA) will replace the Physician Associate National Examination (PANE).

 What resources do people recommend for MRCS part a? Seen a lot of people saying the questions have changed in the last few years and older, previously recommended resources aren’t enough anymore.
 What do people recommend? Is eMRCS still enough? Is medibuddy question bank any good? Is pastest worth the expense? 
 Keen to hear any and all recommendations.

                              <span>After a bizarre few days, the Scottish FM has realised that he can’t continue limping on after shooting himself in the foot, and has resigned. 
 He has obviously had a significant role in the Scottish negotiations for doctor’s pay. He was clearly involved in the deal that Scottish doctors agreed to last year. This was largely due to his desire to avoid NHS strikes which probably gave BMA Scotland a lot of leverage. 
 Now we’re going to have a new FM; which may be another SNP politician, or we could be heading to the polls if an FM cannot be found who has the confidence of parliament. 
 I have to wonder where this will leave us with negotiations. Will it help or hinder FPR? Is the existing agreement (with three years of pay rises meeting inflation as a minimum) going to be ignored by a future government? Will we be striking?

                              <span>So it turns out our strikes were just rookie strikes.
 In South Korea, the government recently announced a plan to increase the number of medical students as a means to provide more doctors to serve the rural population.
 Current doctors and medical students said that this would not help because actually it is the poor working conditions and facilities in the rural areas that discourages doctors from going there, and also high levels of litigation. It is also likely that this would only serve to worsen competition ratios for training positions which aren&#x27;t being increased, and lower salaries.
 The government pressed ahead anyway, with full backing of the media and public.
 In response, the Korean junior doctors all HANDED IN RESIGNATION LETTERS and went on strike. Over 10,000 of them, lite…</span>

                              <span>So I’m post nights and sitting in the changing room. 
 Recently, I’ve had this phenomenon where my self worth is tied to how I perform on the job. It’s a new thing for me as I’ve worked three years now and never felt this way. I’m also hypercritical of my knowledge and my ‘output’ on the job so to speak. I feel the need to be seen as a ‘good’ SHO, I really don’t need to be the best by any means but don’t want to be seen as bad. 
 For example, I see 200 patients and try and sort them, but if something isn’t done like say the porters aren’t down for X-ray by handover time (although I’ve chased them over and over), then I feel completely shite like it’s my fault. If a referral isn’t done by handover time after chasing then it’s my fault. Put those two things together in one handover then I go home thinking about it and can’t sleep. 
 How do you guys manage this? It’s soul crushing.

                              <span>I am an ACF doing IMT. I am due to rotate this Wednesday. I have applied for SL to attend mandatory teaching, present published work, and to take part in a part-time course which I have been sponsored on. I applied for this over two months, but it is yet to be given. 
 The rotamaster is a doctor and has told me I need my CS to approve all SL. I initially did not have a CS and so asked the dept to assign me one. I have emailed them several times over the past few weeks and the SL is yet to be given. The CS keeps telling me they will liaise with the rotamaster however has seemingly not done this yet. 
 Where do I go from here? Everyone seems very nice but things aren&#x27;t moving at all and I don&#x27;t want to miss out on training opportunities and teaching.

                              <span>This is one of the things that really shocked me when I first came to the UK to study medicine, as an international student who’s been exposed to hospitals in other countries.
 I couldn’t help but notice how much worse the hospitals here are compared to those at home.
 I mean, the most basic one of these being no temperature control. Why the hell is every hospital either colder than a freezer, or hotter than a grill? I understand its expensive, but for gods sake it’s a hospital. How is this acceptable? 
 Ventilation is generally piss as well. Why do all the wards stink so much? We need to let the air out.
 Also canteens serving world war 1 era food. It’s either a cold sandwich from Boots, or beans slapped on a potato and some chips. What the fuck. Surely hospitals, of all places, should serve warm, healthy food? 
 I know there are much bigger issues at hand, such as pay, training, and PA scope. But whaaat

 In 5th and 6th year of medical school I discovered nicotine as a powerful and really useful dopaminergic drug. After occassional use of Juul on big research days. when I&#x27;d set aside 18 hours to bash out some research and completely lock in. I hated it because of the health downsides of vaping so only did it very occassionally (1 weekend a month type of thing).

 Another important detail- once I landed my SpR number I encountered a rather uncomfortable bodily change- I don’t want to talk about numbers as such when it comes to size (lets just say it’s in the 2nd part of the alphabet) but I had experienced a phenomenon known as ‘ASBGS’ (adult sudden bust growth spurt) - I was heavily investigated but was told that there have been only a handful of case reports of this over the world with women who have landed ortho jobs although there is no explanation behind as to why it happens.

                              <span>In the light of the previous post, I think a lot of us can struggle with something and that just makes us human .
 This is not for the perfect animal who broke the gym, eats salad juice and is learning the Krebs cycle in their sleep, it is for all the others who feel flawed, imperfect, not good enough.
 Maybe you enjoy too much wine. Or too much weed. Or too much porn. Or you are too depressed, anxious, alone, insomniac or other counter nuances of the imperfect human nature.
 You do not have to be perfect. You are perfect as you are. The flaws are part of you. And maybe that makes you just normal and human.
 No, you did not need to be a drone if you are a doctor. Don&#x27;t let the perfectionist burn you at the stake to satisfy their narcissistic nature.

 Side point: the majority of home visits need to be abolished. The ones that truly need it should be dedicated to a session or two/per week for a GPST/GP.

                              <span>As a US MD working in primary care in the US it is clear to see the root cause of the problem with UK primary care. That is the lack of direct patient contribution to the office visit I.e FATPOA. 
 Because of FATPOA you can never meet patient demand put an extra 500 appointments on per day you will fill them put a 1000 you will fill them. You can never meet demand. Because patients don&#x27;t pay they have no respect for your time, opinion or you! Good analogy is if McDonald&#x27;s said right everything free 24/7 would they ever meet demand? Nope! 
 Here there is a copay it forces people to use their common sense first like use a pharmacist, self care etc also as they pay they respect your opinion and your time also. They are also far more polite. 
 Also you can be a PCP in internal medicine only here so I only see adults no children. Salary of 300k is also very good for a max of 18 patients a day. I got called by a recruiter today offering another job an hour away for 400k salary such is the shortage in primary care here.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just looking to get insights from GPs who&#x27;ve been in the game for a while. As with other markets like stocks and housing, it tends to fluctuate up and down. So is the locum market similar to this and given the current downturn in the market, could it pick up and boom once again? 
 Appreciate it&#x27;s a lot down to government funding for practices and changes with the expansion of ARRS roles, however would like to know people&#x27;s experiences being GP locums

                              <span>I applied for a 5 month career break within the community Trust I’ve been working for for 5 years (I’m a band 6 Dietitian). The board has come back saying that they won’t backfill my position whilst I’m gone, and if they notice that the service is managing fine without me they cannot guarantee me my job back?! I should add that this Trust continously advertises itself as an extremely flexible and employee-friendly organisation. Plus we always struggle to recruit new Dietitians and are not exactly overstaffed, quite the contrary. I’ve been advised by a colleague to speak to HR and/or contact the union. I just wondered if there is anything more I could do/try to ‘fight my case’ or will it be a take it or leave it situation?

                              <span>Currently applying for a Band 7 role, which I hope I get, as I’ve been doing the role on Bank/freelance for the last 2 years.
 My manager has been open and transparent about me trying to negotiate to the mid point - and said they would support the case with HR.
 (For context, the starting salary is only £500 more than my full-time role at present).
 Manager said something odd today like ‘even if you negotiate, you wouldn’t get that salary straight away’. She had to go so didn’t get time to clarify.
 Do I need to pass probation first before I can achieve the midpoint?
 Also, as the Agenda for Change is upcoming in May, would I automatically be entitled to whatever that % increase is?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m seeking advice regarding an error in a summary letter and referral from a recent face-to-face appointment with a clinician at the hospital. The clinician mentioned that &quot;stopping Amlodipine helped somewhat,&quot; however, I&#x27;ve never been prescribed Amlodipine nor experienced any changes in my health conditions. 
 I&#x27;ve already emailed the hospital department administration team to rectify this mistake, but after a month, there hasn&#x27;t been any response or correction made to the documents. 
 What should be my next steps? Whom should I reach out to? This misinformation could lead to a misdiagnosis and presents a false image of my health condition.

 What does a typical day on the job look like, what is the first thing you do when you come in in the morning? 
 What is the next thing you tend to do after that? What different IT systems do you have to use? 
 Where do you waste time and what parts of the job are frustrating? Have you ever had a situation where one of your systems doesn&#x27;t work for you? If yes, why not and how did you get around it?

                              <span>I worked in a location which was featured as a panorama investigation but quit in March. The circumstances around me quitting were due to similar reasons evidenced in the panorama. All this happened post the panorama show. I want to raise a grievance anyway but I also want to report them to CQC and give an update to panorama as I fear they merely scratched the surface of the problem. 
 I just wondered what backlash I could expect to face, both legally and personally, before I do this as I now continue to work for NHS but under a different trust and if it would have implications for practice as I am a qualified nurse.
 I am not seeking legal advice but merely opinions on whether it would get backlash in a legal sense. And whether there is a policy on things like these in workplaces?

 I tried to set up an appointment on the BUPA website, but in the email response it’s saying I need a referral. How am I supposed to get a referral in a timely manner? Surely I don’t have to wait until June to get a referral, or what’s the point of private healthcare?

                              <span>I went to my usual GP for a blood test recently and was told I had to change practices within 30 days as I moved out of their boundary lines. In the meantime, I had a lot of tests at my GP and got a diagnosis via blood test that needs further investigation. 
 This past Friday the 30 days was up and my NHS app stopped showing any info, it gave an error message. So I registered online with a local practice, fearing I&#x27;d be lost in limbo. I am now registered at a new GP but all my blood tests and other results are no longer appearing on the app, I can&#x27;t see old appointments, documents or any historical records. 
 I have an appointment at my old GP on Weds that was scheduled after a last blood result, I am assuming it is still happening... question is, do I need to ask them to send my new GP all my records over, in order for them to show on the app? Thank you if anyone knows and can help!

                              <span>I need help. For the past 4-5 months I’ve had several gp appointments/A&amp;E visits for ongoing chest pain which is getting worse and spreading to other areas (my neck/back/legs). I’ve had the general tests done &amp; an ECG which all came back fine. I’ve been told it is anxiety &amp; there is nothing they can do and I should get counselling. I have been huffed and puffed at and belittled for months by doctors, meanwhile the pain has carried on increasing so much to the point that I can barely get out of bed. I don’t have much quality of life and I spend everyday in tears trying to live with the pain.
 I feel incredibly stuck &amp; frustrated because the NHS will not help me. They keep suggesting I need counselling, but don’t put anything in place for me to gain access to it? I was prescribed diazepam after an A&amp;E visit and it made no difference. Paracetamol and other pain killers have not helped in the slightest either. I had another GP appointment today and my doctor literally sighed at me and told me there is nothing they can do and I should look into psychiatric help, then sent me off home with nothing put in place. Shouldn’t they be the ones arranging that help? I’m at my wits end.
 I’m exhausted from the constant pain &amp; feel helpless because I’m repeatedly being brushed off. I’m willing to believe it’s anxiety as it’s all I hear, but no one’s telling me how to fix it. I don’t feel anxious at all which is what is utterly confusing me, I’m just in a lot of physical pain and it’s unbearable. What can I do in this situation? If the NHS is ignoring me &amp; not putting anything in place to help ease the pain, where do I go from there? I haven’t attended university at all the past month or so due to the increase in pain. I feel totally out of options. 
 I just feel like I should be receiving more help than I’ve been given. The pain gets worse literally everyday, at this point I feel like I’m living in a nightmare. Any advice?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if this counts as medical advice so delete if not allowed but can anyone please help me with what to do. For some time my father has been chronically ill, getting infection after infection and is discharged and readmitted to hospital every month. Everytime they just give him a course of IV antibiotics and send him on his way despite us repeatedly insisting that each time they send him home he deteriorates. I understand the NHS is under a great deal of pressure and they need the beds but it feels they are just repeatedly treating the symptoms without treating the cause. It&#x27;s causing a great deal of strain on the family and ultimately not freeing up bed space in the hospital because he is constantly returning and being admitted for a few weeks each time. We are at a loss as the staff on the wards are just doing what they can to care for him whilst he&#x27;s there but no one seems to have a long term plan? Is there a service within the NHS I could speak to? 
 TLDR: NHS are treating the symptoms of illness but not the cause where can I find advice

                              <span>Can anyone remember when exactly the guidance on blood pressure measurements (and what constitutes hypertension) were changed and when the NHS began following the updated advice? 
 I&#x27;ve researched a lot online but the information is conflicting, some articles say 2019, others say 2023. I&#x27;ve seen one even suggest the changes were made in 2017....can anyone recall? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I’ve been qualified in the NHS since October 2018 and started as a band 5, I progressed to band 6 within 10 months in August 2019. In August 2022 I left my contracted NHS role and have been on the staff bank as band 6 since, working full time but also taking a few months (max was 2.5) off here and there to travel throughout this period of time. I’m planning to go back to work full time and be contracted in September 2024 and wondering how my pay will be affected. I will have been a band 6 for 5 years come August 2024, so I would be at the top of band 6 pay scale if I had continued working contracted hours, but I’m unsure whether this will be taken into account when I start my new job role or if they will start me at the bottom of band 6. 
 Does anyone have any advice regarding this? I know it is likely up to managers discretion, but wondering how likely they are to honour the experience I have when I wasn’t contracted for 2 years out of the 5 as a band 6.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Throwaway for obvious reasons.
 I&#x27;ve recently been forced to realise that I have a problem with benzos (+ alcohol). It&#x27;s not really bad, I can go a few days without using but I do use them on every off day/weekend and I&#x27;ve tried stopping by myself and just don&#x27;t seem to have the willpower. I get the benzos from a neighbour and I have never taken any meds from work. I have never turned up to work while intoxicated - I&#x27;ve always called in sick.
 I&#x27;m currently a core trainee.
 I&#x27;ve decided I need to go to NA but I&#x27;m not sure if I also should see my GP (like, what can they actually do in reality?)
 I&#x27;m also not sure if I need to tell work/occupational health? Given I&#x27;ve never been intoxicated at work and I plan to go to NA, is it possible to carry on without having to inform work?
 If I do have to tell work, what happens? Do I have to take time off or can I continue working? Would I have to extend this rotation? I don&#x27;t think my ability to work is impaired and I get pretty good feedback generally.

                              <span>Hi everyone, hope you have all had a good weekend. Changeover time is coming and I’m facing doing 4 months in Ortho as a CT1. I have never done an Ortho job but I’m keen to learn (and obviously to cope during on calls where I’ll be alone during the day). I’ve started reading some orthobullets, I have OrthoFlow as well. Grateful for any recommendations/pointers about how to survive and thrive. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Considering paediatric training and have been oft advised that you should only train in a specialty if you like how the job looks as a consultant, as that’s where you’re likely to spend most of your career. 
 I’m aware paediatric consultants have much more expectation to be on site out of hours than in some other specialties - does this use up a lot of PAs? Do you end up with lots of days off as a result? How much of the work is inpatient vs outpatient? What roles do you fulfil outside of direct care provision? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi guys!
 I&#x27;m a current FY2 on my final rotation. For this rotation I&#x27;ve gone LTFT (~85% due to fatigue from some meds). My rota coordinator has used 2 of my AL days to give me the bank holidays off (not something I ask for/need, nor was it discussed with me, I just found it on the updated rota this week). She&#x27;s applied this to all LTFT trainees across the board, regardless of %.
 Is this correct? I can&#x27;t find anything that says my AL needs to be used for bank holidays. I understand AL and BHs are pro-ratad, but considering I&#x27;m &gt;80% for only 4 months of the year that surely wouldn&#x27;t account to 2 full days being utilised? Just want to know if anyone has had something similar / knows what our contract actually states, as I can&#x27;t find anything...
 Thanks!!

                              <span>Please can someone advise on this
 Reading the NHSE page on changing specialities, it says that the supervisor must do everything to support the trainee to change speciality, etc. 
 I am not comfortable informing my supervisor/TPD about my interest in another speciality. I still like my speciality, but it is my second preference now. I don&#x27;t want to come across as somebody who is not interested(in case I continue to do this) in this speciality, as it might reduce future training and development opportunities. Moreover, there is no guarantee that I might get a post in the coming round, but I am working towards it. 
 Is it okay to notify as soon as you hear about the new post? Or do I need to tell them before applying, or do they find out from NHSE/Oriel if I am applying to another speciality ?
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>Hi guys,
 GST1 here who&#x27;s interested in going 80% LTFT for ST2/ST3 (England). 
 An ST3 colleague told me that if you go LTFT 80% in a GP rotation, you completely lose the yearly GP premium (approx 9.7k) and essentially just earn 80% of your base pay and that&#x27;s it. 
 Anyone here who did (or is doing) LTFT who can confirm or deny that that&#x27;s the case? Seems crazy to lose 20% and the entire GP premium!

                              <span>Hello all
 Incoming F1 in Wessex, wondering what locum rates are like at Foundation level, any particularly good/bad hospitals. Cheers!

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 Just wanted to ask a little bit more about how LTFT works for shifts like weekends, on-calls and nights? If someone does, say 50% to make it simple, how does that affect the frequency of these shifts? 
 Usually on-calls and nights are 4 days in a row each once a month (I&#x27;m sure it varies between specialities, but this seems to be the most common), if you&#x27;re working 50% of the time - does that mean you work 2 days worth of on calls and 2 days of nights per month or is it more than you&#x27;d still do your run of 4 days, but its done over 2 months instead? Or is it something differently entirely? Same for weekends, if you have 1 in 3 weekends full time, does that become 1 in 6 if you&#x27;re LTFT 50%?
 Appreciate the help in advance, thank you!

 Hope someone can help me with this! I am switching from GP ST1 to a different specialty. I am not planning to return to GP in future. Do I need to have an ARCP 1 outcome?

                              <span>Currently 9 months into F1 and in a cardiology rotation where I&#x27;m being asked to look at lots of ECGs for people with chest pain. I like to hope I could spot a STEMI lol but I&#x27;m really stumped when it comes to T waves, especially comparing them to previous ECGs. I find a lot of the time there are minor differences in the shape of twaves between two ECGs ... I invariably run it past a reg who has a quick glance and says yeh probably fine. Some common problems:
  
Comparing two ECGs and there is new TWI but also the QRS is flipped - is this lead placement/positioning and how can you actually know?
 
How far apart do two ECGs need to be to comment on &#x27;dynamic&#x27; T wave changes. Admission ECG and 3 days later? Or within 30mins / 60mins of each other. Can a dynamic twave change be flattening as well as inversion?
 
if a patient is admitted with a baseline ECG showing some TWI, and on repeat ECG their twaves have flipped the other/ &#x27;normal&#x27;, is this as concerning as flipping the other way
 
 thank you!

                              <span>A couple of weeks ago, I failed PACES for the second time, another £700 and 2 months of my life outside work down the drain. Coming out of the exam, I thought it went very well, I got the diagnoses, gave reasonable differentials and management. I opened my results and for around 4 stations I have not been given the marks that I know I earned. I won’t detail every station but be rest assured, I nailed a lot of those stations and was genuinely given half the marks I earned for a lot of them.
 I know for a fact that if the exam was video recorded I could load up a video of the stations, show it to another set of examiners and get awarded a pass. 
 In-person medical exams are video recorded in the PLAB OSCES, US medical schools and some UK PhD VIVAs are recorded. It&#x27;s entirely possible and worth the hassle to prevent doctors getting screwed over and getting our time and money unnecessarily taken away from us on top of pretty draining jobs. 
 I think it&#x27;s about time we stood up to the RCP and told them that we deserve exams that are objective, fair and consistent. 
 Is this something others agree with?

                              <span>As medical technology continues to advance, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is becoming more prominent. Many experts predict that AI will eventually revolutionize various medical specialties, but the timeline for this transformation remains uncertain. 
 I’m curious to hear your thoughts on when AI might take over aspects of your specialty. Do you foresee AI replacing certain tasks or augmenting your clinical practice in the near future? For instance, in radiology, AI has already shown remarkable capabilities in image interpretation, diagnosis, and even predicting patient outcomes. Algorithms can analyze medical images with incredible accuracy, often outperforming human radiologists in certain tasks. 
 As someone who hasn’t specialised yet I’m quite worried than sooner than most think an ai will be able to do the job better than a human unless it’s very hands on physical work

                              <span>I&#x27;m a bit lost. I&#x27;m a GP trainee, ST1, in my hospital year. 
 I don&#x27;t really want to be a GP. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll enjoy it. I find the problems in GP boring and annoying. There also seems to be no post CCT jobs. 
 I&#x27;m thinking of switching to IMT. I find it mentally stimulating, and generally interesting. I got an offer, but it&#x27;s at a supposedly horrific trust.
 Also staying in NHS sucks. Rotational training sucks. No control over rota sucks. Pay also sucks. 
 ​
 Sometimes I think I&#x27;ll finish GP and after I&#x27;ll jump ship into health tech or pharma. But is the grass really greener?
 I don&#x27;t want to CCT and flee, except maybe Europe. I&#x27;d like to work in east Asia though, maybe Singapore, just to experience life there. 
 Just venting and reaching out for any words of wisdom at a time where I&#x27;m feeling especially uncertain.

                              <span>Did a stupid thing. 
 Suffered a needlestick from an HIV patient and whilst waiting for OccHealth to come back to me I got impatient and looked up my own blood results on Cerner. 
 Realised after the fact that I really shouldn’t have. 
 Question is should I proactively go to information governance and admit to this? And of course explain myself and promise not to do it again….

                              <span>The state of the NHS is every doctor&#x27;s business. We don&#x27;t have to like Dr Dan Poulter for his decision. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68913287 but fine if you do.
 I&#x27;m afraid things in the political realm do affect the state of the NHS - the evidence is overwhelming. Do you need a list? Start with Doctors&#x27; pay if you wish. Dr Poulter&#x27;s decision is a slap in the face for the regime that has prevailed over decimation of the NHS over15 years.
 This thread is not intent on being a political discussion about whether the NHS is safer in on or the other party&#x27;s hands, please!
 Dr Poulter&#x27;s decision is nonetheless an important signal to the general public and to doctors. 
 Whatever happens radical change will be needed on how the NHS is managed. 
 Let&#x27;s keep the discussion in that area - irrespective of politics. This is yet another opportunity to speak to the media (who trawl these subreddits).

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am going to start FY1 this August and fortunately, I am one of the luckier students who already know what city I will be working in. Fortunately, it is also a city that I did my degree in and the plan was to stay in the same apartment while I do FY.
 Unfortunately, I had to make a difficult decision to split up with my long term partner who I am currently living with. I would like to find a new flat for myself, however, I am not sure if I will be a good candidate for this as I still do not have an employment contract (or a guarantor), even though I have been allocated jobs.
 Is it possible to move apartments this soon before starting FY and still sound credible to the landlord? Is there a letter that my employer can write that would state I will be starting a job in August if I fulfill all the requirements (eg GMC registration, finishing my degree)? My understanding is that you can only receive the actual contract much closer to the start date of your job so how do people manage to get a flat without moving last minute when they are allocated to a new part of the country? Am I fucked?

                              <span>Is there any recommended UK medical youtuber content aimed at educating the UK public on general health matters? Ideally from a doctor or someone credible (not some faceless voiceover).
 For example 1. How to navigate the NHS to get your health needs met (e.g. when to call 111/999, when to go to the pharmacy etc) 2. A basic guide to certain conditions e.g. tonsillitis, flu, anxiety 3. How to make the best use of a 10-minute GP appointment 4. How sick notes (MED3s) work? Etc
 I would love to signpost patients to this sort of resource as it gets somewhat repetitive explaining the same things again and correcting misunderstandings. Is there anything else that would be useful to signpost patients to?

                              <span>Currently working in a department with a toxic culture throughout. I have had genuine safety concerns about trainee radiation protection. I tried to raise these concerns but was very quickly shutdown and warned about the repercussions of raising concerns that there could be consequences….
 I’m belittled/ bullied by senior colleagues on an almost daily basis and the toxic environment has resulted in me becoming severely depressed. 
 Currently considering quitting altogether as I’ve had enough. 
 Has anyone else had similar problems?

                              <span>My understanding of salary sacrifice is that you give up a proportion of your gross salary to lease a car so that you get taxed less. 
 However, from what I understand, different trusts have signed up to different schemes. This would mean that if you’re a trainee rotating through different trusts then you’ll have to give the car back every time you move. 
 Are there any trainees out there who have done this successfully? If so then how? TIA.

                              <span>I’m 35 (f) will be 36 at end of this year. I’ve got quite a varied background in terms of career. Teacher for 5 years, then moved to IT project management following a software MSc and stayed for almost 7 years. Recently I’ve been struggling in my PM job with the pressure/hours/internal mismanagement and decided to follow my 18yo self’s dream of working in healthcare and becoming a nurse so I took a job as a HCA in a local trust with a view to studying and working at the same time to become an RN.
 Nearly a month in and I’m miserable. There’s an underlying culture of bullying from management to lower bands and it’s bitchy and there are obvious cliques. The drs and senior nurses are really patronising and often make jokes that I’m the most overqualified HCA they’ve ever had. The pay is horrific (which I knew) and my elderly parents are leaning on me increasingly for financial support. My partner and I are thinking of starting a family soon and as I’m not getting any younger I think it might be wise to return to corporate (not to the same company) for more stability, better wage and more flexibility once we have kids.
 Should I stick it out with healthcare or go back to corporate? My issue was more with the company I worked for as a PM as opposed to the work. I figure that time isn’t on my side in terms of having a family and that’s more important to me than anything right now. (I posted this in Life Advice but realise this thread is more suitable)

                              <span>Questions: 1. Are SIGN guidelines the equivalent of NICE in Scotland? 2. If so, could anyone direct me to the SIGN guidelines for the treatment of EUPD (I’m struggling to find them). 3. If not, are they generally the same as the NICE guidelines? 4. Any general advice would be appreciated. 
 Context: I was “unofficially” diagnosed with EUPD a really long time ago and no one ever told me. I’m contesting it with the CMHT and not being listened to. 
 From reading the NICE guidelines, generally my take away was that the patient should be fully informed and involved in their treatment. This didn’t happen with me. When I’ve asked about diagnosis before I’ve only been told “we don’t want to diagnose you, just treat symptoms”. No psychology referrals were ever explained to me. I went to them so I wouldn’t be discharged from services but they were geared towards trauma and consistent emotional dysregulation and it confused me honestly. 
 This year however, I’ve been talking very directly about diagnosis and still only receiving deflection. I was treated very obviously for it at a crisis centre but they wouldn’t be honest. I brought it up directly several times saying I don’t agree that I have the condition. I had to make a subject access request to confirm. (I now see the lack of good practice that led to the assumption and it’s pretty shocking). 
 The Mental Welfare Commission told me that if I asked about diagnosis I should have been told one of two things: 1. You’re being treated for EUPD 2. We don’t want to disclose your diagnosis to you because it may worsen your condition. They also told me I should have been told one of these anyway unprompted. 
 It doesn’t appear that I’ve been treated in accordance with anything, but I’d appreciate some clarity on this? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Bit of a confusing title, but hope someone can offer an opinion?
 I had an usual mole scanned at Boots and uploaded to a consultant dermatologist. I received a call to say it looked benign but has been marked as suspicious due to it&#x27;s location - removal and biopsy were recommended. GP took it seriously as they also provide this service and reffered me on the two week pathway.
 I was seen a couple of days ago at the hospital and the doctor couldn&#x27;t have been more judgemental and dismissive of me using the mole scanning service. Despite admitting he&#x27;d never heard of it. Accused it of being some AI app that just increases their workload. I was made to feel like a silly time waster before he&#x27;d even examined me.
 When he did examine me, he concluded that my mole was very atypical and suspicious and needed an exision biopsy!!!
 Anyway, this will be done in 2-4 weeks. In the meantime I&#x27;ve been reading about The Mole Clinic which appears very reputable and provides a consultation and exision which is then sent for biopsy on the same day.
 OK, perhaps they still not might be to see me within a week and the NHS time-frame isn&#x27;t really that bad considering, but then up to another 2 weeks for results. It&#x27;ll be about a 4-6 wait in total.
 However if I get this done privately then I&#x27;ll effectively be discharging myself from the NHS clinic which feels super risky. Then, if the mole comes back as cancerous, I&#x27;ll be screwed because I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;d have to be re-referred by my GP? I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be happy about that, and then would the hospital clinic even take me back as an urgent referral after binning them off?
 It seems like a bad idea, right? I think my anxiety about it is affecting my judgements.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi,
 My orthopaedic surgeon verbally told me I should expect to be operated on between August and September this year but I want to start making holiday plans. How much notice does the NHS give prior to the confirmed surgery date? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a band 7 job interview coming up in a week. Part of the interview is a presentation and then they’ll be questions. I’ve done so much prep for this role and I really think I’d be a great fit for the position. I get really nervous on the spot though so I had a couple of questions:
 Are notes ok to take into an interview? Just key points to remind myself what I want to get across. I’ve never used notes before but I’ve read on here some people have?
 Is it ok to ask if I’ve answered the question fully? I’ve done a lot of reading/research and I’m sure I’ll forget to say things that I actually do know. Any tips apart from -‘did that answer your question?’
 Thanks in advance! Just trying to calm my nerves slightly

I’m pretty desperate to be able to make an appointment for some health issues which wouldn’t necessitate an A&amp;E visit and I’ve got genuinely crippling phone call anxiety so those options aren’t really viable. Can anyone advise on how long they had to wait for their ID check? I would like to add that I had to use an EU ID as I’m not a British citizen but I do have settled status, would that impact the waiting time?

 Of course there are plenty of jobs without these but if I only rank the ones I want will I be guaranteed one of the ones I rank ?

                              <span>As a US PCP attending I do speak some old UK colleagues who are GPs still and looking at how things are there these are the main benefits in the US
  
Pay - easy to make 300k here when factor in bonuses and sign on etc which are standard. You get relocation money plus a very good pension scheme 401k etc 
 
Copays - As patients pay directly towards your consultation they have much more respect for you and your time. Also they will try self care, pharmacy etc etc. They also know it&#x27;s easy for a Dr to code their visit in such a way their bill will be jacked up to the max (level 4 consult) so they know it&#x27;s in their interests to be polite to you. Patients know full well things cost and are less demanding as a result 
 
Staffing - much better support staff here who do obs before you see the patient and also handle the paperwork
 
Patient numbers - I only see max 18 a day and that is rare. Get 40 mins - 1hr for physical and new patients and 20 mins for follow ups
 
 Disadvantage
 I would say main one is hassle with insurance companies but our support staff deal with that a lot and take away the burden.

                              <span>I have a few MRCS OSCE related questions for doctors who have passed this exam. 1) Which centre did you give your exam at and how were the examiners there? Is it true that UK exam centres have a higher pass- rate? 2) Which resources did you really find to be useful for the exam? 3) How did you motivate yourself when you didn’t get the desired outcome for the exam? 4) Tips for preparation and scoring well
 Any feedback/ advice is appreciated. Please feel free to give even the tiniest information you might have; even the smallest information matters to me. TIA :)

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m a FY2 and always wanted to learn how to titrate NIV settings. Unfortunately haven&#x27;t had a resp job and the nurses at the hospital I&#x27;m based at tend to adjust the settings very well on their own for the most part. It&#x27;s really nice of them but I feel it&#x27;s a gap in my knowledge I want to address.
 I have nights coming up where I will be covering the resp ward. Whilst the safe thing I am going to do is run past any NIV patients and ABGs I&#x27;m unsure about with the reg, I would be grateful if anyone could give their recommendations on how to go about learning NIV settings and adjusting them based on the blood gases? Also how it&#x27;s decided to wean patients off NIV and how to go about that.
 Any books or resources would be great! Thank you!

                              <span>I have my concerns that the PA argument is becoming monopolised by Twitter fame-hungry accounts using a serious issue- in my opinion one of the most pressing facing our profession- as a vehicle for attention.
 It is concerning to see this ongoing. For example: browsing Twitter this morning, there is a prominent account- that shall remain anonymous- who regularly posts wide reaching, anti PA rhetoric. “Great”, you might think.
 Unfortunately; they also post a lot of nonsense. In the last month they have claimed to have been born and grown up in a working class council estate in the north of England, and a couple of weeks later claimed to have been an immigrant from another country moving here for university.
 I’m worried that, when unverified, popular, but questionable accounts (unclear if they are even genuinely a junior doctor) take charge of an important message like that on PAs, their own suspicious activity will damage the message they become so closely tied to.
 Can the BMA do more to advertise that they should be the official spokes people on PA matters in the same way they have been so successfully for strikes?
 This movement is too important to get brought down by questionable characters harnessing it for their own media profile.

                              <span>I just wanted to know how correct are indicative post numbers at the time of advertisement? Let’s suppose a specialty advertises an indicative post number between 170-190, how correct is that figure in terms of the actual posts being offered by the end of the round? 
 This particular specialty has given the first round of offers for 100-110 posts only. Will that number increase over the course? How does it actually work?

                              <span>In a reverse of what we usually do - anyone any experience where you WERE rude/unprofessional to a patient but no deal was made of it?
 A patient was leaving ED and kicking up a fuss as their phone went missing. They were annoying but not ultimately rude/aggressive. They kept pressing me so I just said “do I look like lost and found?” And walked away
 Another (within earshot) informed me (rudely) that if they weren’t seen in 10minutes they were leaving. I explained the wait time was approximately 9 hours and she huffed and left. More almost turning to the people beside her in the waiting room I just vented and said “wow, what a crying shame” as she left
 All in all not very big but I had a couple of complaints from the ward which weren’t so bad
 Anything else?

 Just realised whilst on the Pearson Vue website that you had to book before the end of March for the May sitting.
 I’ve paid in full and everything, I just thought I could book it whenever before the actual date considering there is only one day to do it unlike msra etc. 
 I’ve emailed rcs and will call on Monday but has anyone been in this scenario? Should I just accept I’m sitting this in Sept now 😭 I’m in no rush to do the exam but I do want that money back if I can’t do it May…

                              <span>Bring back paternalistic medicine! 
 Patients don&#x27;t always know what is best for them. Quite frankly a lot of the general public don&#x27;t have enough knowledge to be able to properly weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of complex treatment options, and we don&#x27;t have the time to fully explain things in a way that these people will understand. We should make the decision and present the best option to them. I&#x27;ve seen too many patients recently make stupid choices regarding treatment because they don&#x27;t understand the chances of success and failure. 
 Example: Experienced vascular consultant gives patient option A and option B. Option A is to do partial foot amputation. Consultant informs patient that the resulting wound is extremely unlikely to heal due to PVD and that they will almost definitely need to return to surgery to do below knee amputation. Option B is to go straight to below knee amputation which will result in less time in hospital overall. Patient discussed with surgeon and agrees option B. Then family show up and are informed of plan and say &quot;No, absolutely not. We want a second opinion&quot;. Patient then doesn&#x27;t want to upset family and decides to choose option A. Patient has surgery, surgery fails, patient returns to theatres several weeks later. Leg is chopped off. Length of stay is longer. NHS has spent all the extra money of the first surgery for no reason. 
 Surely it would have been better for the consultant to say &quot;This is the surgery that we need to do. It is the only option. Anything less will fail and I will not do pointless operations that have an extremely small chance of success*&quot;?
 *Unless lack of treatment would result in certain death anyway.

                              <span>F2 here. Idk if I am alone in feeling this way. I work hard on my days I am at work including my current anaesthetics job where I ask loads of questions and if sent on a coffee break (too frequent for me but the anaesthetist seems to get grumpy with me if I don’t take the coffee break so I just take them whenever they tell me) I will be doing some reading such as UWorld questions. On my days off, I feel like I have to be doing something that is related to work/medicine (such as QIP, Audit, studying for exams, working on portfolio and thinking about further training and how I go about it). And if I do try to go somewhere nice on my days off, midway I will feel bad and unproductive and will change my course to back home to do something medicine related. I constantly feel like an imposter and still wonder how I even became a doctor as there is still loads I don’t know. The only thing I don’t feel bad about is the gym or cooking food and cleaning. 
 Anyone else feel this way?

                              <span>I’m doing the GIC after getting instructor potential at ALS. Going through the e-learning and it’s all stuff I’ve done a few years ago when I did my med Ed MSc. I don’t remember all the details but I do remember the principles. 
 How much does all this e learning come into the GIC? How much detail do I actually need to revise?

Which specialty or subspecialty tends to attract this sort of personality the most, or is likely to be the most satisfying. Over to the hive mind.

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s controversial and I might get downvoted for saying this but meh I honestly don&#x27;t care. I LOVE hierarchy. Done, I said it. I despise this bs we have in the uk. I was treated in a hospital in Vietnam recently and there was hierarchy. A dr was a dr and a nurse was nurse and a janitor was a janitor. I spoke to the drs and they love their jobs, and believe it or not so did the nurses. Drs respected nurses and nurses respected Drs, and everyone knew their role. I tried to explain to them the concept of a PA, and their brains couldn&#x27;t grasp it, one dr (with her broken English) said she didn&#x27;t see the point of the PA with the role they have Oh one more thing, bring back the white lab coats that we once wore. Let the downvoting begin ...

                              <span>Hey guys, what can a doctor do with a masters in clinical microbiology in the UK, Can I get work in the labs, or will I be pushed aside by the consultant microbiogists and trainees. 
 Any career path for a doctor in that area through masters?

                              <span>I just started on my F2 GP rotation and been seeing patients for 2 weeks. I ensure I discuss most patients with the GPs to double check my plans or if I am unsure of what is going on. Despite this, I have found that I have already made 2 mistakes so far. One of them is a prescribing one where I prescribed a longer course of a medication than recommended as I think I misunderstood the GP&#x27;s advice, I fortunately picked up on it when reading yesterday and will call the patient to let them know before it has any impact on them but this has made me anxious and underconfident. I have very rarely made an impactful mistake in hospital and I unfortunately have this overthinking habit so I struggle with uncertainty and will read up about anything I am unsure about after a work day to learn from it and as a coping mechanism. The downside to this is that I end up identifying issues more than my peers and while this helps patients, it also makes me doubt myself and I worry about my patients and the GPs losing trust in me. I wonder if there is any way to manage these feelings of guilt and under-confidence for doctors who have been in this situation before? Thank you so much

                              <span>Incoming F1 in August and wondering about annual leave- 
 I have two close friend&#x27;s weddings abroad, in the same week, which I&#x27;m looking at taking annual leave for in September. Just wondering how likely it is that I would be able to take five back-to-back days of leave so I can attend both events? Or is it worth just requesting a couple of days and choose which one attend? I&#x27;ll be working on acute med if it makes any difference. Thanks!!

                              <span>As paediatric and GP trainees we&#x27;ve been bestowed the sacred honor of annihilating a backlog of 700 electronic discharge summaries. Marvel as we apply years of medical training to a task so crucial, it can only be entrusted to those with an MBBS—no mere mortal staff could possibly click checkboxes with such precision. Forget the quaint notions of clinics and actual patient interaction; our nimble fingers are destined for the keyboard, crafting these digital epics in a blistering 3-5 minutes each. So on those rare, well-staffed days ripe for learning, remember, the true educational summit is not in the clinic, but in the glow of the discharge summary screen. All hail the medical scribes of the 21st century!

 Does anyone have any resources or recommends learning/ reading about things before starting so that I can start with some idea of what&#x27;s going on?
 I don&#x27;t want to be clueless in the first couple of weeks.
 Any help would be appreciated
 Thank you

 Multimorbid 70 year old nursing home resident with dementia. Comes in unresponsive/low GCS with gaze deviation. Intubated and ventilated and loaded on keppra. Turns out to be a UTI and responds to abx. Seems like they’ve overcooked it with a frail patient with hypoactive delirium and a clear infective cause. Probably causing some lasting harm from ICU. And had an MRIH, EEG, CTH, CTAP, and POCUS in the process.
 Maybe it’s easy to say in hindsight but I would think we would approach this quite differently in the UK. Thoughts?

 Any advice would be appreciated as I would really like to get this job. Great location, great hospital to get experience in and very close to where I live so it&#x27;s all a win win if everything goes well.
 I&#x27;m a recent IMG working currently in general medicine and no experience at all on haematology. 
 Any advice would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hello, quick question. Is it common for NHS jobs adverts (at nhsjobs and tracjobs) to be closed many days before the stated deadline? I tried to apply for a job that was posted on day X stating that the deadline was for day X+13, and the application was closed on day X+2.
 P.S. I know they have the right to do so, but I read that they are obligated to state on the job offer that should the maximum number of applications be reached, the advert will be closed, which was not the case for me (I came across a couple of other job offers who stated so and I rushed to apply).

 One of the questions is asking for post type or appointment. The options are LAT, Military, Substantive and Visitor. Which one do I pick? Is IMT classed as Substantive.

                              <span>I’m a CT1 in psychiatry, a friend of mine tends to complain about psychiatrists all the time. And I can feel that she feels distasteful about me ever since I’ve started in Psych. 
 I love Psychiatry, and I want to continue doing it. But even in the hospitals I have noticed that our patients are not very fond of us, most of dislike us. Which to me is understandable, since we section them, give them depots. 
 After this I made a mistake of looking it up online- why do people hate psychiatrists, and I found so much hate. 
 This makes me miss my rotations in medicine, because I felt more appreciated and rewarded by the patients. However, in psychiatry it’s just soo common to go through racial abuse, verbal abuse, threats, and I can go on and on.
 I don’t know, what is your take on it? Will appreciate some opinions on this, as again I feel very passionate about it, but all this hate is getting to me.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just trying to seek some advice or information on this issue I’m currently experiencing. I’m on a fixed term contract and for whatever reason my initial contract ended on the 28th March and was not extended on ESR till almost the end of this month. This means that I have missed the cut off date for this month’s pay.
 I was told all this was due to delays from execs in signing the business case and several forms that needed approval from different departments such as finance and HR. To me this is non of my fault and have been told that an advance has been submitted but from what I know and what I’ve been told by colleagues is that I will only be paid about half or 60% of the full amount I’m scheduled to get which is a pain.
 I was the advance will be made within 24hrs of payday which is Monday. When questioned whether it is possible to get the full amount or at least confirm the amount I’m getting they seem to deflect both question saying I’ll get it the other amount owed in the my next payslip. Is there any way of me getting the full amount within next week ? 
 I’ve just recently moved into an apartment and it requires month in advance and this months rent all together as well as deposit so money is really tight and could do with getting paid the full amount…
 Has anyone had this problem before? Any advice would be appreciated 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I have been on the wait list for a non-emergency surgery since October 2023. I&#x27;m still on the wait list and it was estimated to be around August that the appointment would come through. However, I am now going abroad for work temporarily, so if I do get an appointment before October I won&#x27;t be able to attend the appointment. Is it possible to be put back on the wait list, or will they cancel my appointment all together? As its not an essential op I don&#x27;t mind if I have to wait another year, I just want to be sure I will eventually have the procedure done under the NHS.

Or should I just go private ( cost depending) We have a family history of b12 deficiency and anemia.

                              <span>I currently have a job offer with an NHS trust, and I was told a week ago that my CoS is still being processed (waiting for 1.5 months now) and I was asked for further docs (IELTS, TB docs, proof of funds, etc which are technically visa requirements, but I complied anyway). I have applied for this opening via trac jobs.
 However, I&#x27;ve been contacted by certain recruiters on linkedin in the past few days, offering to discuss opportunities they have with the NHS. I&#x27;ve told them that I have an offer, and that the CoS is currently being processed. Then they&#x27;ve begun offering the possibility of quicker processing and deployment. They&#x27;ve also asked me to send them my CV, which I have not done as of writing.
 Is it possible at all for legitimate NHS recruitment/application to be done outside trac? Moreover, with the recent change in immigration policies, how can they guarantee people with quicker processing times?

 They certainly didn&#x27;t seem pressed for time, so I&#x27;m not sure why they couldn&#x27;t have demonstrated them or at least printed some out for me? Is this really something I need to go private for or is the NHS actually of some utility here?

 What needs to be considered?
 What are the rules with referrals?
 Can a private GP refer to NHS specialists?
 What about referring in for acute admissions? 
 How much would indemnity be? 
 What platform / software do private GPs use? 
 Are there any apps like consultant connect that private GPs use?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a recently CCTd GP
 I was given an insurance form to do for a patient I have reviewed 1-2 times. It was an insurance form for the pt to buy a house/get home insurance (which I didn&#x27;t have to when I bought a house but the request seemed legitimate)
 I tried to complete the form as accurately as possible. But some questions required much more information than I could realistically process or document or the form. So I wrote &#x27;see full medical records
 This was then queried, so i said can attach full medical record if the patient consents.
 But I feel this might have been the wrong advice. A) don&#x27;t think should really be providing full medical records to insurance companies unless patients really request it B) think if so, would need to go through the notes and redact any 3rd party info. 
 I&#x27;m not sure how to rectify this situation. It was only a few days ago - so i will ask team not to contact pt/release any info. And I can suggest that the form needs repeating.
 But I&#x27;m not sure how to complete the form. I can&#x27;t realistically document every episode of a certain condition/every consultation re this over time.
 Grateful for any advice on how to proceed
 Tia

 I’m on a standard training programme, now ST3 with AKT and SCA passed, portfolio completed and support from ES to CCT. However, my CCT date is set at Dec 24. Is there any way to reduce it?

The amendments, proposed by IHR State Parties in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to strengthen the international community’s ability to detect and respond to pandemic threats, will be further discussed at the resumed eighth meeting on 16-17 May with a view to finalizing an agreed package for submission to the World Health Assembly in May for its consideration and, if agreed, formal adoption.

                              <span>Scotland - Social worker contacted me today explaining that they would require lots of section 47 forms for all those patients who got carer help with medication . Apparently the Care inspectorate is coming round and without such forms SW will be in big trouble. 
 I comforted them with explaining that I will be standing with them in commiseration but certainly would not entertain issuing section 47 forms to capacitous adults who make a decision to seek help from carers.
 I did have a few months ago a conversation with the mental welfare commission who was very clear that asking for help with eg tablet counting, assembling of doses or even asking for complete taking over of sorting the meds is entirely compatible with having capacity. 
 SW is of course heart broken about my attitude. 
 Any useful thoughts?

                              <span>the sessional rate for a GP is 10-11k. That is beyond beyond insulting. How long has it been like this? Why are we not up in arms!

 I know I need to submit form A to the practice in order to get pension pay. However, form b mentions PCSE, but where do I send this if working in Wales? Any advice would be greatly appreciated

                              <span>Anyone got any top tips (serious or funny) to share on how to achieve a smooth and efficient consult? I’ll start:
 Hide the weighing scale before you start any session. If you locum arrive at least 10 minutes before, locate that thing and put it in the cupboard/out the window/in the bin. 
 Me at least twice a day:
 ‘Madam, please step off the scales. You came here so I could diagnose your child with threadworm. It’s not an opportunity for you to check how much weight you’ve put on over the past year…’

                              <span>Hi,
 This may possibly be a silly question. I&#x27;m a current GPST3 eyeing up options for work after qualifying.
 Is it possible to work at two different practices as a salaried GP at both? E.g. Monday Tuesday at practice A, Wednesday Thursday at practice B?
 Would this break any rules? Would it have any negative implications for tax purposes or NHS pension?

I have just been charged another £291 in April (probably the start of their financial tax year). I thought they would charge me again when I start ST2 in Feb 25. Will I receive a refund at the end of CCT as I have effectively paid a year&#x27;s worth of membership for 2 months?

 ​
 I am new GP partner, early 30&#x27;s and wondering what others are doing for pension. Considering as a GP partner you have to contribute employees contribution and the 2015 scheme penalises for you retiring early, are many people using a SIPP instead?

 Thanks for looking after this patient in their 80s recently. Your discharge letter says “lansoprazole withheld, GP to review”. There is no mention of why this was done. there is no drop in kidney eGFR. They have been taking it for many years with no issues. There was a slight brief drop in sodium on admission bloods I see- but many things could cause this. Can you tell me why stopped please?”

 A&amp;G letter to hospital. 
 “Dear team. 
 Famotidine costs the NHS £38 a month so that’s 44 x the expense of lansoprazole or £457 a year. We do try to save money sometimes, in primary care at least. 
 Regardless of this, I issued the medication as instructed and they tried it out.

                              <span>I am grateful enough to have got an NTN for ST3 in a highly competitive surgical specialty.
 However, it is far from my partner and my family. Partner has her own work and it&#x27;s now dawning upon us that the move may not be that easy.
 I have seen the form on ORIEL whereby you can reapply to continue your training in another region whereby you continue at ST4. In essence, you reapply in open competition with the only difference being you have to upload a form with your current TPD supporting your application.
 My issue now is, is it worth doing this? The application window for the speciality basically opens up at the same time I start ST3 in October. Does it look bad approaching TPD to ask him to sign the form at the start of my training? Will he think badly of this. And say I am not successful in reapplying, will the current TPD then screw me over for the rest of my rotations thinking this person didn&#x27;t even want to be here in the first place?
 Some of my friends are saying it&#x27;s worth reapplying in open competition whilst retaining my NTN. But I am scared if I don&#x27;t get in, I will set off on a bad foot with the TPD of the current region which I would then be stuck in for the rest of my training. I don&#x27;t know how TPDs respond to this

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently a GPST2 trainee. 
 I had a close friend who is 8 weeks pregnant approach me on a weekend to ask if I would be able to prescribe some cyclizine.
 She was feeling nauseous, able to tolerate most oral intake with some small amount of vomiting. Background of hyperemesis.
 There were no GP appointments the day before and 111 didn&#x27;t get back to her so she was lost on a weekend.
 Has anyone been in this situation before?
 Looking online, it seems that it&#x27;s legal but &quot;frowned upon&quot; unless it&#x27;s an &quot;emergency not convenience&quot;?
 Would appreciate any input.

                              <span>Possibly a stupid question, but I’m wondering how possible it is to get into Anaesthetics CT/ACCS straight out of FY2 these days? I’m aware that absolutely smashing the MSRA to land an interview is paramount.
 I’m an incoming FY1 but I’ve had a 2 year gap since graduating, which was necessary for health reasons. I’ve got an anaesthetics rotation third and I also plan to arrange a taster week. Does anyone have any tips on how to make the most of these, and how to make the most out of FY1 in general? Have read that audits, teaching, attending relevant events and having achievements outside of medicine are important for portfolio/interview purposes. I don’t have anything in the way of SSC/elective from med school, no distinctions/merits etc (I was a bit of a pathetic student ngl, but I’m read…</span>

                              <span>Hello. My name has roots in a language that&#x27;s quite different from English. People who don&#x27;t know this language can&#x27;t pronounce my name correctly not because it’s hard to pronounce but because they read it literally. It&#x27;s like how the Slovak name &quot;Jana&quot; would be pronounced &quot;Yana&quot; in English. Up until now, I never corrected my colleagues and patients to pronounce my name as it&#x27;s spelled, but that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s really pronounced, and I wonder whether I should start correcting them (as I am starting to feel a bit uncomfortable). People don’t get my name right at first attempt, and when my colleagues are present, they often correct my pronunciation of my name (me: “I’m Jana” … someone “sorry what’s your name again?” … my colleague “Yana”… someone “Ah okay I got it! Nice to meet you, Yana”) 
 Would it be too complicated to introduce myself by saying, &quot;The spelling is Jana, but the pronunciation is Yana&quot;? Should I change the spelling on my yellow badge to match the pronunciation (“Yana”)? What do other people in similar situations do? Should I accept how others call me so as not to complicate my life?

                              <span>13hr shift with a fairly heavy take on acute medicine yesterday, everyone was pushing themselves to keep the flow going and shift as many to the wards as we could manage.
 We got sidetracked about 3am. A 24yo woman presented with soft tissue injuries and dislocated shoulder, with a weekly alcohol intake of 34 units. Audit-C score was 7, but CIWA-A was only 1. No symptoms of AWS. A dispute started between the F1 doing the clerking and the bay nurse, about whether she needed immediate benzodiazepine treatment to prevent withdrawal seizures.
 It escalated in a ridiculous way to include the registrar on duty, then the charge nurse, then the ward sister. Their position was that we should give the full protocol, ours was that she&#x27;d been assessed at low risk and wasn&#x27;t dependent. The charge nurse started threatening &#x27;Datix for patient safety&#x27; and trying to strongarm the F1 into prescribing.
 The argument ended when the professor in charge of the take wandered towards the noise we were making. He listened for a minute, flicked through the patient notes briefly, glanced at the numbers, then turned to the charge nurse. &quot;My alcohol intake&#x27;s higher than that, where&#x27;s my benzodiazepines?&quot; Held out his hand and started making &#x27;gimme&#x27; gestures. No response.
 Long story short, we stopped being asked to prescribe the meds.

I really love the idea of having my own space and am currently thinking of renting alone but also concerned about feeling isolated living in a new area with no support system nearby. Just wondering how people found living alone/with others during your foundation years and what you’d recommend?

 In a nutshell:
 30 year old medic very much of the academic and conscientious but under-confident and unassertive variety. I found foundation training stressful and it basically took over my life for 2 years. I then did a series of locum jobs. The only time I ever really enjoyed medicine was when I had a 9-5 locum gig in an old age psychiatry unit with not much responsibility... I realise I have a lot of anxiety about on-calls and that my day-to-day mood is pretty much predicted by how close a set of nights or weekends or long days are.
 I applied for GP training as I quite like GP (but with 30 minute F2 appointments!) and was worried about my foundation competencies expiring. I then fell pregnant and deferred the job. My baby i…</span>

                              <span>I’m a GPST3 and started in Aug 2023. I CCT in Nov 2024.
 I dropped down to 80% LTFT for GPST3.
 Can someone pls tell me how many days of AL including BHs I’m supposed to have from Aug 2023 to Nov 2024? 😭 I’m at the same practice the whole way through if that changes anything.
 I’m confused about what my entitlements are. I started F1 in Aug 2019 so I will hit 5 years of service on 7th Aug 2024.
 Thank you

                              <span>Was talking to a locum F?-something. Complained of being disillusioned with the training progress in this country and how discouraging it is to see so many bottle necks at every training phase. 
 They go “what bottle necks? Unless you’re some kind of idiot, it shouldn’t be hard to jump through their hoop games”.
 Maybe this sub always echoes negative experiences the most, but I don’t think I was wrong in saying there definitely are bottlenecks lol. 
 Didn’t like 300 qualified anaesthetics trainees fail to go into ST3 or 4 (sry i forgot the official statistic) because the government refuses to create more training places?
 Just thought it was an odd conversation, wanted to share.

I&#x27;ve had very lovely feedback on my TABs/MSFs in the past but I think this is the first time someone has gone to the trouble of finding out who my supervisor is so they could send positive feedback about me. It&#x27;s just been forwarded onto me by email for my portfolio and it&#x27;s absolutely made my day.

                              <span>Hi everyone, hope you’re all well. 
 I’ve just been told that my IMT1 Neurorehabilitation post has been swapped to Resp/Palliative care - which is fine but I want to do Neurology (and neurorehab was my only Neuro based post) in the future and am now worrying this will impact on my ST3 applications? 
 I’ve emailed to see if the post could be swapped to a more Neurology-focussed post, but unfortunately apparently there aren’t any more options available at the moment - they’ve said they’ll let me know. 
 Just wondering what my options might be for this? And if it will impact on speciality applications in the future? 
 Would appreciate any advice! 
 Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m an incoming FY1 trying to rent this month due to my tenancy expiring, and I&#x27;m being passed around many different departments to try and get a reference sorted out. I&#x27;m about to lose the house due to it all (finding a house was really difficult because I have cats, and no getting rid of them isn&#x27;t an option, and no I don&#x27;t have family to fall back on). The deanery won&#x27;t provide me a reference because they said it&#x27;s up to the trusts, and I&#x27;m placed across two different trusts, to make matters more difficult. None of them are able to help and provide me with a generic reference stating basic FY1 salary yet. Has anyone experienced this, has anyone got any advice about how I can get it resolved? Really freaking out about having nowhere to live. Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering throwing in the towel on medicine. Training in the UK is increasingly becoming incompatible with my life aims (yes, more so than they were before). Throughout medical school I wanted to be a psychiatrist, it was the area I was always most passionate about and genuinely exceeded at, whereas I was a very underachieving student elsewise.
 I can&#x27;t help but feel a degree of resentment to those who are applying to psych despite likely having no actual specific interest in the field. This is undoubtedly selfish, but I feel like my field of passion has practically been stripped away from me, as I&#x27;m only able to work in a very specific area of the country due to family commitments. 
 I&#x27;m stuck locuming with the threat of redundancy looming over me, and honestly I&#x27;m spending half my time in a state of anxiety and uncertainty.
 I&#x27;m wondering whether it might be time to get off the medicine wagon and give myself space to breath and retrain as a Psychotherapist.
 Would this be a practical move?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I received superb, expert, compassionate and life-improving care from my local eye hospital. I suffered eye trauma in a freak accident, and thanks to your colleagues I&#x27;ve gone from a traumatic cataract, &gt;60 intra-ocular pressure and other assorted grievances to successful surgery, dramatically improved vision and a low, manageable risk of glaucoma. 
 I want to thank the brilliant people who helped me, in a way that gives them the recognition they deserve from the brass! No doubt they&#x27;ll have handled much more serious matters than mine, but this was a scary episode nonetheless. Their skill and compassion made me feel safe - a profoundly valuable thing at a time of vulnerability. 
 I gather that an email to PALS helps with the portfolio. What I&#x27;d like to know specifically: 
  
Will a single email about everyone suffice? I don&#x27;t remember everyone&#x27;s name (I was seen by a lot of people), but should be able to provide enough identifying info. 
 Will the brass read it?
 Will it be seen by the people themselves? On a personal level, I&#x27;d like them to know just how much I appreciate them.
 
 A couple of nuggets stand out: 
  
The doctor in A&amp;E who calmed me and made me laugh when I was freaking out about my 60+ IOP, and who also had the humility to say that she had to check what to do with the glaucoma consultant. Knowing what you don&#x27;t know and admitting it is surely the most noble form of intelligence. 
 The consultant herself. I suppose we expect consultants to be expert and decisive (she was both), but she was also approachable, attentive and friendly over multiple appointments. 
  
It occurs to me that bedside manner is more memorable to patients than hard-earned clinical skill. Perhaps that&#x27;s just because we understand it better. Anyway, it stays with you, and I salute you all for retaining your humanity in a society that under-values you. 
 Sorry for banging on. All insights into what&#x27;s best for your colleagues are welcome!

                              <span>FY1 rotated onto surgery (3 weeks ago) after 8 months of medicine.
 I&#x27;ve noticed over the last couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been feeling a bit down. Struggling to be present, a little more anxious, and just not as happy.
 Only made the realisation today that a big part of it will be unfulfillment at work. On medicine I was seeing patients independently, having good relationships with seniors, and feeling like a valued member of the medical team. On surgery, the seniors haven&#x27;t even bothered to learn my name, I am not using my clinical brain whatsoever, and I spend all day doing ward jobs.
 I don&#x27;t want to feel like this for the next 3.5 months. I don&#x27;t dread going in and when I&#x27;m in I am not having overtly bad days, but I&#x27;m just not enjoying life as much. Does anyone have any tips, inside or outside of work, for dealing with this?

                              <span>GPST rotating in Medicine.
 Received no induction for this post.
 Had a look at the rota when I received it 8 weeks ago, it showed I was working 8-5pm on the 1st May Bank Holiday. Nothing on the rota showed I would be specifically be working. I spoke to my fellow GP colleagues who said it would be an off day as I&#x27;m not oncall. No word from the rota coordinator regarding this either.
 Now the rota has changed to show I&#x27;m working an acute ward 8-5 on that day. I&#x27;ve already booked my tickets abroad and it will be expensive to change. 
 How should I approach this?

                              <span>Hello from across the world! I am a final year medical student from Australia (postgrad), who recently did an elective in London - I loved the city and would love to live there for a portion of time.
 I know things in the NHS are bleak, but wondering if anyone has any experience coming from Australia to the NHS temporarily? The proximity to europe is a big selling point.
 Not sure what stage of my career/UK training this would be possible, I’ve seen the posts around locum positions being harder to come by etc. In Australia we will now have a 2 year internship system (similar to F1/F2), and people will generally work in HMO/SRMO/unaccredited registrar jobs whilst trying to get onto training (can be many years depending on specialty).
 I know people often move internationally for fellowships, however with how long specialty training now takes in Australia, I would likely be mid to late 30s by that point and children makes things harder.

                              <span>Hello kind friends!
 I will be moving to the UK from Oz at the end of the year to start a Clinical Research Fellow job in London. By that point I will have GMC registration as a specialist (neurology).
 I had heard from seniors who did similar work in the UK many years ago that they supplemented their income by doing clinics on some weekends where they saw patients who are basically on a backlog waiting to be seen by specialists in a public clinic. I was wondering if this is still a thing nowadays and how feasible it is to pursue this for supplemental income and what the logistics may be to seek out this type of work?

                              <span>Why is there so little respect for EM as a specialism amongst specialties? We are at the hospital generalists at the sharp end and can deal with all emergencies in all specialisms and have a broad but limited knowledge of all specialisms. We hand you patients with undifferentiated pathology wrapped up in a bow and yet you still reject appropriate referrals and manage to complain to no end. We see three times as many patients and discharge two thirds. An acute medic can’t manage croup in a child and an orthopod can’t manage ACS. We can manage all cases and filter undifferentiated pathology

                              <span>Good Morning All,
 First time poster here so be gentle. Been doing F3 and F4 locums via an agency (will keep their name off here) and have spoken to one of my colleagues about the use of umbrella companies. He has informed me that he uses the same company and is getting full take home pay and is sorting out his taxes with his accountants. He has said he has been happy with this arrangement but has recently found out through 2 different agency staff that used to work at this company that they where actually not paying the VAT and the agency staff would take a fixed percentage of this on a weekly basis in forms of a bonus from the &quot;umbrella company&quot;. 
 I was shocked by this and have spoken to a few agencies about this and been advised that there is only two companies that allow this practise and I am shocked and appalled by this. I&#x27;ve calculated it to be that some people can be making £2000 per week from their locum doctors. I have no proof other then these conversations but am I right to feel concerned and what is the best practise? I am not using the same company as my colleague so cant imagine it is being done with my pay.

                              <span>Some may be unaware of the big issue. Basically the Inquiry is investigating 2000 mental health deaths in across NHS trusts in Essex. The Inquiry has been given legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence (but only after pressure from relatives and the Chair of the Inquiry. 
 &quot;Dr Geraldine Strathdee [.....] had said she could not effectively do her job without those powers. She said only 30% of named staff – those essential witnesses involved in deaths she was investigating – had agreed to attend evidence sessions.&quot; Read all about it! https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/28/inquiry-mental-health-deaths-essex-nhs-trusts-given-legal-powers
 Check the Inquiry website for more details: https://lampardinquiry.org.uk/
 Nobody should be under any illusion that excess deaths among mental health patients isolated just to a patch in Essex. 
 I&#x27;ve been pissing in the wind and foaming at the mouth about the state of care in mental health services for the last 10 years. It is indeed deplorable that &#x27;people have to die&#x27; before anyone takes real notice. But.. but.. that&#x27;s how the Empire works. &#x27;You&#x27; could spot the same pattern of operation in several other spheres of UK life. 
 Well in the background I have factual inside information that lawyers are queuing up to sue (somebody). Who&#x27;s going down? Some from high command and some low hanging fruit. 
 Who&#x27;ll be going up? Where? Why that&#x27;ll be &#x27;some doctors&#x27; to the sacrificial altar of the GMC!! What - you don&#x27;t believe it? Just wait. 
 Horror stories in your patch of mental health services? Do share anonymously (no details that may identify an organisation or individual, or that are before a court or likely to be before a court). Not necessarily about deaths but what about abysmal care?

                              <span>I finished GP training at the end of January and went away travelling. Pay is staggered so I was expecting a February payment for January. I was expecting some sort of payment in March as my tax and remaining hours were added from February. Then I got a payment in March similar to my normal pay, I have again now received the same amount, this is a continuation on their behalf of my normal pay. Due to financial difficulties, I would struggle to repay these two payments. Can someone outline an email I can send to Payroll to rectify this matter, Ive read about agreeing a payment plan is this a well trodden path in this situation?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Keen on dual training in the future but I’m foxtrot oscaring to Australia at the end of F2 for a year or two. Can this time in ED count towards the “medical part” of my training? I’m lead to believe that I’m better off doing ACCS to avoid being an ST5 reg going back to be a gerries SHO. Just wondering if my ED experience in Aus will count and I can do Anaesthetic Core Training and then apply for an ICM number in ST5? 
 Cheers

                              <span>Today is the final day for the govt to offer the BMA SAS committee an alternative to their previous offer. Do we think it’ll go far enough? As an associate specialist on locally employed T&amp;Cs I hope we’ll be included this time. I don’t hold out tons of hope in all honesty.

 Secondly, if anyone is working in Wales, could you please highlight the average pay in IMT 1 with on-calls etc?

                              <span>Hi team,
 I’ve already got plenty of tattoos but in pretty ‘safe for work’ areas - above elbows, torso etc.
 I’m into them, they make me happy and they’re cheaper than therapy post Covid ICU rotas. Outside work I’m in a hardcore music band and they’re very much part of the culture too. 
 I was thinking of getting some on my arms, and eventually even hands/neck when I find designs that are suitable. 
 Does anyone care anymore? I’ve got a training number, I kind of think ‘f*ck it’ at this point. I am aware though that this is not everyone’s opinion and there is a lot of unconscious bias around them, particularly job hunting if I’m planning to CCT and flee. 
 Ideas, concerns, expectations? Thx.

                              <span>Hello all,
 It&#x27;s your friendly neighbourhood IMG, who has never lived in London. I got offered a post in the South London Deanery, and I could use your expert opinions.
 The first thing that I am worried about is the cost of living. Will I be able to afford to live on my own in London with the salary of an ST3? Seeing that now I am almost 30 years old, I think I am ready to start making a step ahead in my life and try to get my own place. I dread the fact that I might be going into my early 30s and not being able to afford to live on my own. 
 The second thing that I would like to ask for your advice on is which areas of London would you advise me to seek a house in. My deanery is going to be in South London, but I have heard rumours that it can be quite dangerous. I have never lived in a dangerous city in the past and I would rather avoid areas with high criminal rates. Which areas would you recommend? Do you think it is a good idea to live above the river and commute every day?
 One final thing that I would like to mention is that currently I am not able to afford a car, as I have spent a fortune on my Royal College exams, courses, study material etc. Will I be able to reach the hospitals in my Deanery using public transport or is owning a car a must?
 Many thanks! xoxo

                              <span>Was speaking to an old colleague back in the UK he says it is quite common now for trusts there to recruit consultants in all fields directly from overseas with minimal if any UK experience. How is this allowed? With such bottle necks in training there it makes it even more ludicrous for hospitals to take these shortcuts. For all the gripes with US training at least it&#x27;s on a level field once you are in residency you are guaranteed an attending job no ifs or buts and you won&#x27;t be gazumped by someone from overseas.

                              <span>How to handle difficult colleagues i.e. you are an F1 and your reg tells you to come in to work 2 hours before you are meant to start. Of course you won’t be paid for this time, however they are your senior and you don’t want to ruin your relationship with them as you will be working with them for the next 4 months. 
 Please feel free to share your own personal experiences and how you dealt with them, as an incoming F1 with social anxiety and a hatred of confrontation this is something that really worries me about starting work

                              <span>Like the title says, I’m expecting to be involved in an SI. For obvious reasons I will be very vague about the details. 
 My biggest mistake was not documenting that I escalated it to the consultant, because consultants are notoriously bad at documenting their actions thereafter so I guess on paper it looks like I was the last contact with the patient. Before I knew the final patient outcome, I told the consultant about my anxiety around the situation and they said “it’s fine, you escalated it to me, it was my responsibility”, but obviously I didn’t write that on paper and they didn’t document anything after that. 
 Fully expecting to be contacted about this case and am beyond anxious about how it will play out. 
 I’m a foundation year. Will involvement in something like this affect my future career? 
 As soon as I felt out of my depth with the symptoms, that’s when I handed it over to the consultant. Technically the symptom was escalated to me, but I didn’t know what to do so I escalated further. We all know the first month of rotation is very much finding your feet, I had no idea what to do in this specific situation, hence the further escalation as I wasn’t getting anywhere. If something goes wrong, do consultants often field the responsibility and inquests themselves or do they often bounce the blame back at the more junior doctor? 
 I’m absolutely terrified and this physical and overwhelming anxiety is enough to make me seriously question a future in this career. I don’t ever want to be involved in this stuff but it seems like perfect storms happen and I fucking hate this

                              <span>I would like to ask for advice from doctors on how best to communicate with them after seeing a doctor at an UTC today. I’ll explain what happened but there’s some context to it I’ll outline first.
 Two weeks ago I was diagnosed with cancer and my child doesn’t yet know. I’m tired, stressed and am doing my best. That’s the context. Today I took my child to the UTC after being unable to seek advice about the best thing to do from the GP. My child had two unexplained falls (one witnessed) two days in a row e.g. didn’t trip, wasn’t pushed. I thought I needed to just check they were okay today after the second fall (lump on their head) so took them to the UTC. After being triaged and waiting for a few hours we saw a doctor (FY2). I was told that as there was no loss of consciousness or vomitin…</span>

                              <span>I just wonder if everyone who needs a booster is able to get one. In the last round I was eligible for one due to a family member&#x27;s medical condition, but the NHS have changed the rules meaning I no longer qualify, strangely. I found it desperately hard to find a pharmacy in Scotland who could do a private one - I just happened to be driving through near a place that did it. Otherwise I&#x27;d still be waiting. With the cost at £75 that is going to make it even harder for people to get one. I&#x27;m worried that people are going to be at risk due to location or financial situations.

SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate and evolve with important genetic and antigenic evolution of the spike protein.
The objective of an update to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition is to enhance vaccine-induced immune responses to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.
As the virus is expected to continue to evolve from JN.1, the TAG-CO-VAC advises the use of a monovalent JN.1 lineage as the antigen in future formulations of COVID-19 vaccines.
In accordance with WHO SAGE policy, vaccination programmes should continue to use any of the WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination should not be delayed in anticipation of access to vaccines with an updated composition.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an img due to CCT in less than a year, and it just keeps looking like I should either leave the UK and/or GP as a speciality.
 First off, GP is really grueling. Infact more gruelling than my previous job in ED. Most people seem to only be able to tolerate 6-7 sessions/wk. As a salaried that can be as low as 66-77k a year. As a clinical fellow in ED I was making 63k after banding. Like...what is the point in being a salaried GP? 
 Like I can genuinely make more than this, if I currently go back to work as a clinical fellow job in Wales,Scotland or NI. It would probably be easier too.
 Last week, my supervisor the other week said to me &quot;it&#x27;s true the job market is bad. It&#x27;s true that you are competing with ARRs roles&quot;. So I have to work super hard for 66-77k. Pathetic. Why not just retrain in literally any speciality in Wales?
 I don&#x27;t understand. I really like this country and want to work here. But why would anyone continue to work this hard in GP? Like It&#x27;s feel literally crazy for me to stay in this country. 
 Please tell me I&#x27;m missing something. I must be missing something.

                              <span>Adult nurses are so much more helpful - they won’t sigh, roll their eyes and behave like you’re asking them to move a mountain when you ask them to do a set of observations or a urine dipstick or to give a prescribed medicine to a patient. 
 Every single paediatric nurse I’ve come across in my time as a doctor (except for a handful I could count on one hand) have been nothing but entitled, rude and quite frankly unwilling to do anything asked of them unless they want to do it. Also find it bizarre most claim not to be trained in taking bloods from children and expect an F1 or any other doctor who doesn’t come across children nearly as much as them to do the bloods instead. Paediatric trainee doctors constantly have to do their own urine dipsticks and observations - can their HCA/nurses not do this? Adult nurses are also busy but they don’t go around saying “im busy I’ll try if I can get round to it” when you ask them to do the most basic thing. Also paediatric nurses when they speak to speciality teams honestly just come across as rude and entitled and quick to behave passive aggressively or straight up rude. I find the temperament of (most) adult nurses to be a lot more mature, level headed and less likely to behave like a bratty teenage girl. 
 Could someone shed light on this?

 I’m in the dark about the lowest rank offers in psych at the moment. Are people actually receiving offers from the recent recycles, or is it just radio silence for everyone? If anyone has any information or updates on this, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

                              <span>Hello all
 Managed to get an offer for LAT in gastro in Northern Scotland. Ranked bottom order end. 
 Im inclined to accept this as want to get into a structured program rather than spend time as trust grade or locum. I am split but generally glad tbh. 
 Questions 
 1- what are the experiences of people who have done LAT? How does this affect applications next year? Does it help? 2- Any idea where Ill be spending the year? I would hope it would be ARI rather than iverness or shetland as that would be less than ideal. 3- What is the expected salary take home for st4 as i understand the taxes are different compared to England? 4- Any comments about training and training opportunities up north? 5- Any comments about living costs and accommodation 
 Thanks in advance 
 Kind regards

                              <span>I feel like a lot of oncology patients who are admitted with acute medical problems haven&#x27;t had resuscitation discussed with them by their oncologist, or haven&#x27;t got a DNAR in place in situations when they really should have one, so I end up discussing with them and completing the paperwork. Do you as oncologists reverse these decisions when you see patients after they&#x27;re discharged?

                              <span>I went through medical school always wanting to be an orthopaedic surgeon. I graduated and completed FY1 and FY2. I then got into core surgical training on the second attempt - this was a huge feat for me and I worked damn hard to get in. I thought I’d made it. I thought I was finally going to be a surgeon. My CST years were some of the most gruelling of my life - i sacrificed so much to progress and prepare a portfolio for St3 applications. The MRCS exams took a huge mental toll on me. I sat Part A 3 times and passed Part B the first time. Regarding MRCS, I wasn’t alone. I know a lot of my colleagues who also had multiple attempts. Since finishing core surgical training, I have applied to ST3 Trauma and Orthopaedic surgery 3 times. I have been unsuccessful each time. I thought this year was different. I had prepared very well only to be thrown under the bus in the interview. The clinical scenarios were much harder than previous years and I feel like the whole interview process was just poorly delivered. I am also disappointing my family and friends by not getting a training number so the mental toll is a lot. I am planning to give it 1 more shot next year. I guess I just came to Reddit for some motivation during a time where I feel as though all hope is lost.

 How do you approach this as an SHO? 
 Surely, if they were extremely concerned they can send the patient to A&amp;E where they would then be referred to the specialist if needed. Or, they should see the patient themselves and then refer appropriately.

                              <span>For example ent has a month of Locum’s coming up, nights only. Ent is also very strict about how long you’ve spent in the specialty post f2. 
 If an f3 locum did this month of nights would this count as time spent in a specialty. What does the hive mind think?

                              <span>IMT3 here, funnily enough IMT breeds burnout (who&#x27;d have thought it!). But everyone around me (literally every other IMT3 I work with) is hellbent on entering training ASAP as everyone says there won&#x27;t be any training numbers left soon. Everyone else is off to take ST4 numbers in August. I&#x27;ve taken a more chilled approach this year as it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite the mega competition of core training (yet....) and my mental health is sort of in the toilet.
 I&#x27;d love 1-2 years out to decompress, see the world, see family, be a normal non doctor human. I&#x27;m pre kids so I could have a lot of freedom and nice times. Or I could aim for ST4 next round starting training in Feb 2025 (if I&#x27;m lucky, there should be numbers in areas of country I&#x27;d like to live in).....
 Is being a consultant lots better? Should I be pushing towards consultancy soon and ending the misery of med reg night shifts and rotating? Or will I be a 35 year old consultant with a couple of kids regretting prioritising my career over a couple of fufilling years out of training?
 I&#x27;m female and expect to take a few mat leaves and then LTFT so I suspect I won&#x27;t get there very fast regardless, it&#x27;s whether or not I add 1-2 years extra on by taking some time to chill now vs cracking on with HST for a couple years at 100%. We see young people die at work which I think skews my view that life is short and work doesn&#x27;t matter all that much.
 I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone who entered ST4 after a couple of years out, do you regret it now when you see people who were at your stage and are now consultants whilst you&#x27;re still working nights? Or do you feel lucky that you had amazing experiences that you just can&#x27;t have in your 40s/50s when tied down by kids and a mortgage?
 P.S. I really like my family/friends in the UK, so despite the absolutely appalling weather I don&#x27;t want to CCT and flee so this would be based on life staying in the UK for the long term

Now that I have my payslip, how do I find out if I was paid for that day? If I add up the worked/earned column should it equate to how many hours worked in the month, and when does the pay month begin/end? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have completed core psychiatry training and have opted to take some time out of training for personal reasons and am looking to move to a speciality doctor role (potentially long term and looking for some protections e.g. sick pay, parental leave, etc., hence why I am less keen on locuming). 
 I&#x27;m struggling to find a huge amount of information about what nodal point I would come in at on the SAS payscale. Is it nodal point 4 because I have three years of psychiatry experience or is it nodal point 8 because I have over seven years of NHS service? I have also read that people have had some success in negotiating there starting point with their trust.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ll start off with fonts and styles. This may be of importance to those doctors whose work is text-intensive and where quality of presentation matters e.g. senior doctors in psychiatry and expert witness doctors. 
 In psychiatry the work is text intensive for producing reports of various kinds: Tribunal reports, Managers&#x27; reports, CPA, CTR, Court of Protection and so on. Presentancy is &#x27;everything&#x27; (chuhknowwhuhahmean). Most &#x27;medics&#x27; - or is that doctors - don&#x27;t give a monkeys about fonts or Styles. Some don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s that Style ribbon at the top of MS Word is for, nor do their typists (secretaries or admins). I&#x27;m not doing a tutorial on that here. 
 What is of relevance is that for the doctors who need to format there work for &#x27;presentancy&#x27; and readability (like me) are being told that Trusts require all correspondence to be in Arial 12pt, by policy. No such policy has been found over the last 10 years of me searching for it across 10 Trusts. I dare say it does not exist.
 But wait - I started off with one issue to illustrate something else that happens in your beloved NHS What&#x27;s that?
 Loads of people make up policies as they go along. The commonest is &#x27;good practice&#x27;. Nobody quoting anything of &#x27;good practice&#x27; has been able to provide me with a reference to the &#x27;good practice&#x27;. 
 The other one was &quot;No patient gets Sectioned unless they have a CTR (care and treatment review).&quot; No such policy exists in writing anywhere and if it exists it is legally wrong. 
 And another, &quot;Intensive support must be consulted before a LD patient is sectioned&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t exist. Can&#x27;t find that anywhere (though it may well exist in a neck of the woods somewhere that I&#x27;ve not been). 
 I&#x27;d like to hear from those who have witnessed the same sort of making up of policies.

                              <span>Trying to avoid ranting. Here&#x27;s my experience. 
  
was on waitlist for fy1. Found out shortly before starting where I was working. Jumped in to hospital accomodation. Had a detrimental effect on personal life being short notice. Didn&#x27;t have time to sort a flat. 
 in a pretty depressing part of the country. 
 got bullied during one rotation by senior doc. Was very stressed and put my head down. Didn&#x27;t get signed off. Some concerns. Overall 90% of feedback is good. Still unsure what will happen come ARCP 
 during above period, a romantic relationship fell apart. 
 I was very burned out but managed to get some sick leave with strikes which gave me a couple weeks off. 
 I have enough left in the tank to finish just about. 
 I have to move from current location. 
 I have connections in a good ed (which i like) in a nice city, apparently there is locum work there. Buts it&#x27;s expensive. 
 I also have connections abroad down under. Could get a job there. 
  
-right now I&#x27;m unsure of next steps. It&#x27;s pretty daunting thinking about moving. I&#x27;m just exhausted and dont trust myself.
 I just need a break now. Any kind words or words of wisdom appreciated. I&#x27;m better but still stressed. I have spoken with PH and gained some support. In counselling. any kind words appreciated.

                              <span>Quick question that has me a bit baffled…
 I was in an elective c-section, after birth baby had poor tone and no initial respiratory effort. Anyways after resuscitation by the midwife, the buzzer was pulled as baby’s sats were still low despite inflation breaths, NG aspiration of stomach and subsequent face mask O2.
 In response to the buzzer and “paeds” being called, an ACP from paeds attended. She was great, and I learnt stuff from her when I was asking questions about management, and it seemed that everything right was done for baby.
 But an ACP? To essentially a crash call? For adults senior doctors attend. So what is going on here? The ACP seemed quite well versed in everything, but this doesn’t sit right with me. 
 There was a point where the ACP said “if things don’t improve by x time, I’m calling my reg”, but why wasn’t a paediatrician there initially? NICU is on the same floor!!! 
 I know that even paeds isn’t safe from scope creep and noctors, but can’t we get real doctors to attend to a neonatal emergency.
 Maybe this was because it hadn’t quite gotten to cardiac arrest? But initially wasn’t far off.

                              <span>Hi, I was just wondering whether people have been successful with interdeanery transfers after having a baby born. Current deanery is over 1.5 hours away from parental home, and unfortunately daycare hours are not enough as they do not cover weekends or hours after 6pm. Also, having grandparents pick up child from daycare if need be, any advice would help appreciated

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve found a ridiculously good deal for a holiday in Jan 2025 for a 2 week package - is it worth the risk to book this and then negotiate AL/swapping shifts? I&#x27;m completely naive to the rota and AL as a doctor as I&#x27;m still a final year medical student hopefully starting FY1 in August 2024. Please can you enlighten me? My 2nd rotation is a medical job in a tertiary centre in a rather niche specialty (I think it&#x27;s niche anyways - endocrinology) if that adds any weighting to your advice. I also want to say thank you in advance to everyone who replies, I&#x27;ve posted quite a few times asking all my silly questions and have always received amazing advice and replies so tysm to you all!!

                              <span>Hi guys, having looked at the IMT scoring matrix I just wanted to check as it doesn’t explicitly state on the website, can you use surgical/other specialty achievements such as audit/publication etc as part of the scoring for the IMT long listing assessment points? Aware that for interview purposes obviously better to have medical stuff but just in terms of pure points is this allowed? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m on a community placement and we often get medical students coming through. Last week we had a student join us during the morning MDT meeting and introduced herself as a medical student. We did a few cases together during the week and she seemed uninterested in anything I had to teach but was very keen to jump in and take over the patient interviews. I didn&#x27;t mind her confidence but she took irrelevant histories and didn&#x27;t seem to understand a lot of basics. She always tried to go out of her way to agree with the consultant and it felt like she was trying to &quot;one up&quot; me. It really didn&#x27;t seem like normal behaviour for a medical student so figured she was just a very driven student who had yet to start her downward journey on the dunning-kruger graph.
 I found out from one of the nurses that she was a nursing student, and was told many of them introduce themselves as medical students, which we agreed was disingenuous. She later confirmed that she would be finishing nursing school soon when asked in front of our MDT.
 I&#x27;m not originally from the UK, but is it normal for nursing students to identify themselves as medical students? I was introducing her as a medical student, and now I&#x27;m feeling guilty about misleading my patients.

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m starting GPST1 in August in Derby.
 I&#x27;ve ranked all my allocations but can&#x27;t seem to figure out which ones are HEFT or not. I&#x27;ve contacted the Admin team which aren&#x27;t very helpful. 
 Can someone tell me where exactly it specifies that rotations are HEFT? It doesn&#x27;t say anything on the preference list for me, or when I click each rotation for further information. 
 Would appreciate any help, thank you.

                              <span>It&#x27;s seems every patient is complaining about the NHS, especially GPs. A few months ago I drafted a response to a bizarre patient complaint... the patient had booked an appointment under her name so her dog could get some antibiotics for a cough/chest infection. I&#x27;m not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation. Then she complained to the practice and when rebuffed, went to the NHS obusdman who shut her down too. What is wrong with people!?!?!?
 So guys, what&#x27;s the funniest or bizarre complaints you&#x27;ve been part of?

 I&#x27;ve been asked to step up as a stroke SpR to cover gaps. I&#x27;ll have to do ward liaison and TIA clinics and hold the bleep.
 I want to ask for some advice and perspective on what will be expected of me and where I can brush up my knowledge.

                              <span>I have applied and been accepted for this diet of PACES by the RCP Edinburgh.
 When applying they asked where I have worked, to which I answered the city hospital I have spent the last 3 years. 
 They have put me in the DGH ~30miles away. I am due to continue working in my current hospital and am not due to go this DGH, or any other nearby, at all during core training. However, it does fall under my deanery.
 I had thought you couldnt have PACES in your home deanery, but am now realising I can&#x27;t find anything online to that effect.
 Have I lucked out, or has the royal college made an error?

                              <span>have been reading about the placeholder issue, and spoken to someone affected. its an absolutely awful situation and given that UK medical graduates require F1 to have full registration, it shouldn&#x27;t be that people are left without that year.
 European medical schools have the last year as part of your medical school - well you do work but unless apply to leave and work elsewhere you work locally in a hospital.
 please can someone who knows the historic background explain why this was changed in UK?
 and wouldn&#x27;t it be better if everyone had the first option to stay locally (guaranteed in their deanery) with those who have good reasons to leave apply to leave? rather than this lottery mess?
 and if we thought this was better, how can we as seniors petition for this / support this to happen?

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 I was hoping to get some advice about what I could be doing during my gap year before f1.
 ​
 I’ve been allocated this year to a region that is well away from my support network and would not be good for my mental wellbeing to start working this year whilst feeling isolated.
 ​
 Although there is no guarantee this won’t happen again next year, I am considering taking a year out.
 ​
 Has anyone taken a gap year before F1? Any suggestions on what would be useful to do for speciality applications moving forward?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I was an international student that graduated from a UK medical school in 2020 and completed FY1. Due to issues at home I had to leave the UK and foundation programme post FY1 to be at home and have been working in my home country as an SHO grade doctor since in Internal Medicine (staying until the end of FY2 was not really a viable option at the time). 
 When I had left post FY1, my foundation school was under the impression that if I were to consider coming back, this would be via a standalone F2 post or CREST form - which I have been made aware in the last few years that CREST is only open to doctors who have never been in the foundation program. 
 Was wondering if anyone has advice on available routes back to the UK, as well as if I were to attempt to return - if it would have to be back at F2 level or if I would be able to apply for training later on should I plan to complete further qualifications eg MRCP exams. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 So, I work on an elderly care discharge ward, where people are supposed to be MOFD. But spending months waiting for social issues to sort out, they keep getting new medical issues.
 Plus, there are chronic medical issues that families want taken care of, while they are in the hospital, as an opportunistic bonus.
 Now, its basically just me and a PA (nice but relatively new). Before, it was me and another SHO and we used to divide patients evenly.
 We&#x27;re being told to prioritize TTOs rather than clinical reviews because pharmacy can&#x27;t process orders (dosette boxes) in time if we do them after noon
 The issue at hand is that i usually need time to look at a patient my own way, and write in my own style. I&#x27;m a bit conscious of making sure that I&#x27;m not missing any key details when reviewing a patient, or that any TTO I write is well written.
 Also, the ward manager is insisting that instead of breaking up patients, we divide tasks instead. Things like &quot;Oh, the PA can write the discharge summary and you can prescribe.....&quot;
 The PA is a nice lady and she can take bloods decent enough...(somewhat)
 The problem is, I can&#x27;t review patients late (all the investigation results and imaging gets delayed), and I seriously hate prescribing meds (Especially CDs) when the written portion is a missing key details (like why a drug was discontinued or whether a resus status was changed)
 I take pride in my work, and want to do it in its entirety.
 Does anyone how to handle this kinda workload?
 It&#x27;s gotten so bad that normally, an MOFD patient is supposed to be reviewed every week just to see if they&#x27;re ok, and no one&#x27;s reviewing them for 2-3 weeks.

Reason I ask is because my employer said that May is my last pay check. CCT day (June 1 st) and workplace has me on their schedule as working a normal day.

                              <span>I was invited for a cervical screening a couple months ago by my GP practice and had the test a little over a month ago. They told me the result was going to be communicated to me by post in up to 4 weeks. I already have had an altered result for a smear test before (they knew it) so I was worried. A couple days ago I received a text message from NHS England booking me an appointment for a colposcopy. 
 Now, I’m also a healthcare professional and know what a colposcopy is and the reason why they had booked me one (the test showed abnormal cells) but this was never actually communicated to me by any means. I called my surgery, they said the doctor would call me back that day. They never did. I replied to the text message to rebook the appointment since I’m gonna be in my period on the date …</span>

                              <span>My question is I was employed by the NHS from Jan 23 as I understand you get 1only get 1 month sick leave in your first year. It&#x27;s now nearly may 24 my question is am I still considered in my first year of service or my second year of service? I was told that I had to complete my second year of service before I&#x27;m entitled to two months sick pay, which doesn&#x27;t make sense as I&#x27;d technically be in my third year of service?
 Do I need to complete the entire year of service before I&#x27;m entitled to second year service sick leave or am I entitled to that now as I&#x27;ve technically worked here more than 12 consecutive months.

 Community midwives and health visitors are completely useless.

                              <span>I’m feeling desperately unwell &amp; NHS practise here says problem with blood test but refusing to give me results - say I need to speak to doctor but doctor “unavailable” - next appointment is in 3 weeks. That’s enough time to do permanent nerve damage if something like B12 deficiency or other deficiencies. 
 Previous practise in countryside never posed problems like this- they emailed results promptly &amp; booked doctor appointment at later date, but allowed you to see result before appointment. 
 This is my data- it should be law they they cannot refuse. Had this nonsense before in other practises as well. Unbelievable!

                              <span>I left A&amp;E yesterday due to the wait times which I know is because hospital staff are stretched thin. I wasn’t formally admitted I don’t think by which I mean I didn’t see a doctor, get a bed or like a wristband. I spoke to a nurse on the floor of the waiting room I was in about not wanting to stay any longer than I already had, who told me I could sign some self-discharge papers, which I did. Today my final discharge papers from there have come in where it says “patient walked out” under diagnosis. That sounds like I just up and walked out without saying anything to anyone but I’m no healthcare professional so I’m not sure if that’s okay. I wanted to ask if anyone knows if that’s all okay and adds up, and if it’s likely to cause any issues now or in the future? Thanks!!
 I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this so if not I’m sorry

I do not feel able to return to my current role but do not want to leave with no job to go to. How can I legally attend an interview?

                              <span>I got my first choice GPST rotation:
 6 months GP.
 3 months hospital rotations x2.
 6 months ITP - 2 days GP and 3 psych.
 3 months hospital x2.
 12 months GP.
 They&#x27;re saying that if I do it 80% LTFT I won&#x27;t meet the 12 months in hospital requirement because ITP doesn&#x27;t count?! Despite it being over half the week in psych (they said I&#x27;ll only get 1 day of GP if I&#x27;m part time).
 So I&#x27;ll have to do an extra 3 month hospital rotation or convert ITP into 4 days psychiatry instead of 3 + 1 GP.
 Does this sound right to anyone?

 Admin from primary care services is asking for evidence of my professional indemnity. Should I get the practice to write something as evidence that I would be included in practice indemnity or I should get MDDUS to give me a quote for a nominal coverage? 
 Been a salaried with a Scottish health board since CCT so has been covered under CNORIS with a nominal 0 session coverage with MDDUS in order to join the performers list. Going to move health board now so a bit confused.

 What is the ratio of f2f vs online?
 Who delivers it?
 How is it delivered? (e.g. powerpoint, group work, simulations, tests/quizzes)
 Is there a plan or schedule of topics that will be covered over the year?
 Are you asked for feedback and is that feedback named or anonymous?
 What would you suggest to improve it?

                              <span>It&#x27;s seems every patient is complaining about the NHS, especially GPs. A few months ago I drafted a response to a bizarre patient complaint... the patient had booked an appointment under her name so her dog could get some antibiotics for a cough/chest infection. I&#x27;m not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation. Then she complained to the practice and when rebuffed, went to the NHS obusdman who shut her down too. What is wrong with people!?!?!?
 So guys, what&#x27;s the funniest or bizarre complaints you&#x27;ve been part of?

 I&#x27;ve had two complaints so far and I&#x27;m feeling a little deflated. My trainer has said the patients were being unreasonable both times, and apart from being &quot;more polite&quot; there wasn&#x27;t any learning to take away. She didn&#x27;t even recommend writing a reflection on them, which I may do anyway but I&#x27;m not sure how to word it? Or what learning I should be taking away?
 The first one: I asked the patient to book another appointment to discuss problem #3 as I had others waiting and had started to run behind. The issue wasn&#x27;t urgent - I quickly checked red flags and then booked him in for 2 days later. He called later that day, angry that he had to come back in. I thought I&#x27;d been pretty polite about it, explained that I needed to take a full history and do another examina…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to work out whether I need to be asking my F1 and F2 trusts for a pension rebate because I worked additional hours as a locum from which pension was taken off. 
 Struggling to find information on whether pay above full time hours / locum pay while being on a substantive contract is pensionable. 
 BMA seems to suggest all pay should be included &quot; Accrual in the 2015 scheme is based on each year’s actual earnings and service and whole time pay is not relevant. From 1 October 2022 Officer pension contribution tiers in England and Wales are linked to actual pensionable pay and not the notional full time equivalent rate.&quot;
 NHSBA seems to suggest differently &quot;Overtime, in relation to the NHS Pension Scheme, is hours worked in excess of the whole time standard working week. Therefore a part timer’s pensionable pay must include any additional hours worked up to the whole time working week, and hours worked over the whole time working week are not pensionable. For example, if the standard working week is 37.5 hours, a part timer normally working 20 hours a week may pay pension contributions on up to 17.5 additional hours per week.&quot;
 But then also this from NHSBA? &quot;The payroll solution must use the previous scheme years actual pensionable earnings to set the member contribution rate (instead of using whole-time equivalent earnings). If the member did not work a full year the actual earnings should be annualised.&quot;
 ​
 What&#x27;s right? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m just not reading it all correctly tbh.
 Is the best thing to do just to ask payroll?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m an incoming F1. I&#x27;ve managed to get really lucky getting my first choice rotation in my (granted not-competitive) first choice deanery. All exams have been passed and its just placements standing between me and working as a doctor. 
 While I am excited, I&#x27;m starting to get really nervous. I&#x27;ll be at a hospital I&#x27;ve never been at before, I don&#x27;t know anyone else who will be working at that hospital. I know this is the same for most people, but I am really worried I won&#x27;t find anyone to go through the tough stuff with - I feel like it&#x27;s taken me all the years of medical school to finally find a group of people I&#x27;m at least semi-comfortable with. I feel like I&#x27;m just chronically misunderstood by peers and I am just worried about how everything will all go. 
 I&#x27;ve already spoken to OH, they have mentioned something about a WRAP form but other than that I don&#x27;t even know what can be done to help someone who&#x27;s autistic in a ward setting. 
 I guess I&#x27;m just starting to panic a bit. I suppose I&#x27;m looking for reassurance that foundation is doable, and maybe some tips if anyone has any. 
 Thank you 🙏

                              <span>I was lucky enough to get a post for core anaesthetics training and will be starting in August. 
 I want to try and do a bit of background reading before I start to hopefully make it a bit easier during the novice period. 
 I appreciate many people will say this isn’t needed but I have a decent amount of free time during the day to use up as I’m currently on a GP rotation that’s pretty chill and can still enjoy my weekends / evenings etc
 A few people have mentioned the e-learning for healthcare course. I was wondering if anyone could point me to any other good resources

                              <span>Hello 👋 
 I am looking for some advice from anyone who has left medicine for another career. 
 Whilst I enjoy clinical medicine - I have recently begun to question its sustainability as a longer term career.
 I’d like to use my transferable skills, but ultimately work in a non-clinical role (if healthcare adjacent) or a completely unrelated field.
 If anyone has practical advice or real life experience - I would be grateful to hear from you. 
 Thank you ☺️

                              <span>F2 here going to F3 and did not apply for training this time due to personal reasons. But will apply for 2025 start. I can’t imagine myself in any specialty other than histopath and I am quite set on it but the insane competition ratio is quite disheartening and I feel even with a QIP in pathology, a first author publication (non histopath but is related to another medical specialty) and some teaching experience (delivered occasional teaching here and there but planning on histopath specific ones aimed at FYs) and tasters, I won’t even make it to the interview. So to maximise the points, I was looking at events hosted by RcPath but they seem to be aimed at consultant level doctors rather than suitable for absolute novices like myself. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Do haematology events count (from what I know this is a group 2 medical specialty rather than a pathology specialty so was unsure whether there was any point)?
 Any tips?

                              <span>Looking for advice on getting an SAS / specialty doctor post in sexual health / GUM.
 I&#x27;m a GP by background (CCTed a few years ago), and have worked in a non clinical public health related job for the past year. I&#x27;ve got an interest in sexual health with a couple of previous GUM jobs during training and have done the DFSRH. A little out of date with it all now, but really enjoyed previous work in this area. 
 I&#x27;d really appreciate advice from anyone who works as a specialty (non-training grade) doctor in sexual health. Particularly interested in how you ended up in this role, what level of experience is needed, and how I can improve my chances of getting a post. 
 If anyone is willing to have a chat or offer some advice on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!

This isn’t unique to this job; all of my patient lists in my previous jobs have been on Word or Excel documents on an L drive. 
 Surely there’s a slicker, GDPR-compliant, NHS Trust-friendly of going about this? What do you guys use?

                              <span>Hi all
 Got a Neurosurgery JCF job interview coming up. I&#x27;m quite excited about it since I&#x27;ve enjoyed previous surgically-minded jobs, and have been reading up common emergencies that I might deal with eg post op hyponatremia.
 Problem is when I try to look at troubleshooting ventricular drains, most guidelines essentially say &quot;call neurosurgery&quot; or to replace the drain.
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone might share their insights into a JCF&#x27;s approach to common issues. What might I be phoned about from the wards, and what would they expect me to try in the first instance before escalating to SpR?
 Thank you for your time.

                              <span>I was doing a clinic today with my consultant &amp; there was an assistant with us helping and coordinating the patients. One of the patients was grateful and very emotional and brought us biscuits as a gesture. When the patient left the clinic, the assistant immediately picked the 3£ gift and went: “Are we even allowed to accept that? I’ll put it in the staff room and you can help yourselves if you want you”
 I mean FFS !!!! Our assistants are so brainwashed from the ridiculously demeaning position of NHS doctors that they would not even have the courtesy to ask permission from the consultant, who the gift is presumably for and who is also in charge of their own clinic, before taking the gift away.
 I did a good job for my patient, my patient expressed their gratefulness by gifting a 3£ biscuit, I felt rewarded that they are grateful- but no, the NHS culture would make sure to remind us that we do not even deserve this gesture.
 I am so fed up with the recurrent manifestations of this upside down hierarchy at the NHS where everyone think, act and actually are the bosses except doctors. I think this culture towards doctors at the NHS is so bad that I doubt reversing it would happen in my lifetime and I would rather run away than spending my career devalued.
 Rant over

                              <span>Hey everyone, I’m a final year due to start in Aug. Currently doing ward jobs atm with a fair bit of free rein (under supervision of course). I normally do really well with osces etc however I feel like doing the daily reviews etc, I’m struggling to come up with my own plans and just forgetting stupid stuff- such as day 2 post-op with (in hindsight) very obvious pneumonia/Lrti presentation. In an examination it just comes naturally to say things like XR etc but on the wards I just feel like I’m forgetting really stupid stuff and the management plans I know I can do just aren’t translating in to practice?
 Wondering if anyone has any advice thank u!

                              <span>I&#x27;m peripherally involved in simulation training at my local medical school. The simulator is pretty simple: a mannequin, a monitor, some dummy drugs to be drawn up or checked, some blood gas print outs and people pretending to be nurses, registrars etc. The trainees are final year medical students, FY1s and FY2s. The simulated scenarios are vanilla adult medical and surgical emergencies in which the trainee is called to the ward for a patient that&#x27;s &quot;gone off&quot;.
 The scenarios themselves seem pretty realistic and I try to make the debriefings as educational as possible using the After Action Review model, but it seems the trainees get no particular preparation on emergencies before the simulation day and there&#x27;s no follow up afterwards on lessons identified. It&#x27;s just one or two simulator days a year in isolation. I&#x27;ve discussed this with the faculty who run the simulator but their view is that preparation and follow up are Someone Else&#x27;s Problem.
 Has anyone had better experience of sim training than this?

                              <span>Hey guys-I&#x27;m back with another MRCP part 2 exam question. I think cardiology is really screwing me over....I&#x27;d appreciate any advice. Thank you in advance. 
 A 45 year old is admitted with palpitations following excess alcohol consumption at a wedding. His BP is 90/50 and his HR is 130 bpm and regular. 
 Bloods were all normal. 
 ECG: 
 ​

 What is the most appropriate intervention?
 Amiodarone
 Digoxin
 DC Cardioversion
 Metoprolol 
 Verapamil 
 ​
 I thought that since he&#x27;s haemodynamically unstable we would go for DC cardioversion however the answer is amiodarone. They stated that since the patient has a junctional tachycardia the treatment of choice is either IV amiodarone or IV flecainide. 
 I had a read about junctional tachycardia vs SVT. 
 So junctional tachycardia is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR &gt;100. SVT is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR &gt;150. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good paper to explain the management of junctional tachycardias because it sounds a bit different compared with SVT but I can&#x27;t find anything. One paediatric paper said that we can give amiodarone, another said phenytoin. And wikipedia has actually been the most helpful and said that we don&#x27;t normally do DC cardioversion in junctional tachycardia. 
 Is anyone able to shed some light on the management of junctional tachycardia and how it differs to SVT?

 Mysteriously vanishes after the ward round and makes themselves uncontactable in the hope that the other resident doctors will give up trying to get hold of them and do their job for them.
 What is the best way to tackle these colleagues as an SHO?

                              <span>I completed a QI project with a colleague last year. I came up with the idea and did most of the work (probably a 70:30 split between us). We presented this and my name came first on the presentation. 
 I would like to submit our work to a conference as a poster. I don&#x27;t need my colleague&#x27;s help for creating the abstract or the poster itself. Does their name still need to go on the poster as they were involved in the work that happened prior? My suspicion is probably it does but I thought I would just check! Thanks.

                              <span>Adrenaline is presented as 1:1000 and 1:10000 solutions. 
 Does anyone know why we don&#x27;t just say 1mg/ml or 0.1mg/ml? 
 It just seems odd that we do it that way for such an important drug and often you get passed the wrong thing at arrests and such. And you end up back calculating in your brain for infusions. 
 I don&#x27;t ask for &#x27;1 in 100&#x27; propofol&#x27; or &#x27;1 in 200&#x27; bupivacaine. 
 Is there some historical reason?
 Why stop there with the slightly confusing descriptions? Why not ask for one 60th of a grain of adrenaline from the apothecary? Is it just me who finds this more confusing than it should be?
 So many questions.

 My question is - do you have to rank all the jobs available within your deanery or just the ones you want eg 20-30 jobs? 
 Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi all,
 The joys of rotational training and service provision have meant I will be placed in a hospital 70 miles away (1:40hr travel each way).
 My TPD is not very reasonable and quite mean as I had found someone to swap with but she would not let us swap. 
 I am thinking to ask for 80% LTFT to reduce the travel burden but am worried this will get rejected as other than making my life easier and being closer to family for longer I don’t have a super concrete reason.
 Is it worth asking or should I just suck it up for 6 months?

                              <span>Saw this posted on X, and seen its generated some debate for two reasons 
 1) ANP led consult (as expected always generates a convo) 2) variation in differentials from doctors and others alike
 So what do we all think ?
 Looks like contact dermatitis/ hidrandentitis suppartiva to me but could be wrong.
 (Seen someone comment its shingles which made me giggle)

                              <span>Question - are you allowed to do a taster in the same specialty twice?
 I did an anaesthetics taster this time last year at the end of FY1. Enjoyed it a lot and applied but didn’t get in due to MSRA. Hadn’t done any anaesthetics placements before that. Now have done an FY2 ED job and loved that too, so between the two.
 Worried about basing an entire career on a four day taster and not sure how I feel about it now which is why I wouldn’t mind doing it again but unsure if it’ll be approved.

                              <span>Lefty here. I have started training as ST1 in o&amp;g and I’m finding it so awkward to start operating, doing knots, etc. 
 I have started to use my right hand for most things because it feels more instinctive- but I suppose the handedness of the instruments (as all have been designed for right handed users) forced me to start using my right hand.
 Using my right hand feels awkward. Using my left hand feels awkward and painful (physically hurts to open the needle holder…. And lost instruments, with the L hand)
 How did lefties manage? Are there any resources? I haven’t found much online or on YouTube. Anything will be appreciated (:

 So I have had multiple depressive episodes throughout my life but the current one is the most severe so far. After remaining off work for 2 months, I returned to work a month ago. But things started to go downhill again and I have been signed off again for a short period of time.
 Apart from being fed up with the illness and life in general (maybe it&#x27;s worse due to the nature of the illness), I am also worried about being unemployed. What if I don&#x27;t feel better for a long time? Will I lose my training number? What about GMC? Also what about sickness triggers? Will I be subjected to HR reviews and what nots? I do enjoy my work and my speciality but I am completely burnt out from attempting exams and building portfolio and cannot see a future for myself when I am off sick for this long. 
 I have had 4 years of NHS service and should be eligible for 5 months of full pay. Despite explaining all these, payroll has deducted my salary and paid me peanuts. I understand that I have to chase it up and involve BMA but I have no fight left in me to deal with this.
 I did speak to my ES about all these who listened to my concerns but did nit offer much advice. I have had private counselling in the past but I cannot afford this anymore. I am completely overwhelmed and I would really appreciate if any one has any suggestions or just some kind words.

                              <span>After speaking to a couple of colleagues, it seems to be a consensus that it feels like service provision only.
 Teaching is a tick the box thing and most of the time uses archaic methods. There is no official allocated person and it relies on good will. They just throw a lot of information at you to cover the curriculum.
 The workplaces highly rely on you. Therefore, there is almost no time to thing through.
 Everything feels a tick exercise: presentations, supervisor meetings , portfolio.
 Plus: they bribe you with a teaching feedback if you teach medical students who pay expense yearly fees and were supposed to have allocated preceptors and etc.
 Does anyone have different views?
 Any hope things might change ?

                              <span>What are some of the weirdest conducts of colleagues that went unnoticed? 3 years in the NHS and I&#x27;ve seen some weird stuff. But some conduct cases always baffle me. Worked with an F1 who was least interested. Was alcoholic. Came late to work almost every day. Was a threat to patient care. Never really got caught in any tribunal or conduct cases somehow. Was made to re do the F1. Still has remained the same. But somehow finished F1 and now going to complete F2. Another doctor who shouted at another doctor on one incident was removed from training and referred to GMC (not saying it was right). Just weird how some blatant cases go without any major consequence, while others which we feel isn&#x27;t extreme is taken to GMC.

                              <span>Hi, wondering if anyone has any experience of this - is a current FY3 (so OOP) eligible for removal expenses if they are going into a training programme (GP if it matters). The guidelines aren&#x27;t quite clear, they say &quot;Trainees who are deemed to be out of programme (OOP) will not be eligible to claim relocation, temporary accommodation or excess mileage payments whilst they are out of programme but may claim expenses in order to support them returning to their training programme.&quot; Obviously am out of programme now, but won&#x27;t be once the training programme has started and so at the time I&#x27;d be claiming?

                              <span>The last installment of the Cass Review into care for gender questioning and transgender young people has been published this week, as I&#x27;m sure people have seen in the news. The big changes are the stopping of prescribing puberty blockers except through a clinical trial and a general shift in attitude away from an affirmative and medical pathway for gender transition towards exploratory psychological counselling. It&#x27;s been praised by both political parties, but criticised by trans groups and international organisations.
 Apart from the merits of these changes, does anyone know why this took the form of an independent service review rather than a national guideline by NICE/ RCPCH/ RCPsych or if there are plans to produce one in the future. As far as I can work out the old GIDS service was working off the The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines which have now been declared unacceptable by Dr Cass. Has there ever been a UK guideline produced in this area?

Salaries can only keep falling so much before people accept private salaries (even assuming private salaries will be lower, as claimed by some people). 
 
Post-CCT salaries also look like shit
 
 We need to go private and take the trainees with us. Design the private curriculum to be of a higher standard than the NHS. Take a page out of USA/Australia curriculums. 
 Various stages of fleeing might be an option for some, rest of us have to make do. Private healthcare, for patients AND doctors, is the only option.

                              <span>I received an offer for an ST4 cardiology position in the East Midlands South, but the start date is listed as February 2025. Do these posts usually start in February? I thought most began in August. Can anyone confirm? Also, if anyone has any reviews about the cardiology training there, could you please share them?

                              <span>Hello 🙋‍♂️ I’m an F1 and so am still new to how pay works. I believe I have paid too much tax for the 23-24 financial year (due to locums) and that I should be due for a tax rebate. I’ve been on my HMRC online and it says “your income tax has not yet been calculated for 6 April 2023 to 5 April 2024” 
 When do tax rebates typically get paid out and how is it paid? Thank you!

                              <span>Training places 
 All specialities will trend towards how neurosurgery is today. Hyper competitive. Virtually impossible to obtain a training number post foundation for many years. This will force more and more doctors into locum work. 
 Locum work 
 The rise in foundation doctors not getting a training number, previous F3,4,5s etc, and IMGs will saturate the market to the extent that there will be very few locum opportunities, and the rate for locum SHOs will continue to fall. 
 Unemployment 
 Eventually the market becomes that saturated that essentially as an SHO who has just finished F2. You don’t have enough experience to secure a training number, and there are no locum opportunities. So what do you do? You’re essentially unemployed from a medical point of view. No fellowships, no trust grade jobs. All over subscribed. 
 I give it 2-3 years before doctors unemployed in hundreds if not thousands. What can be done? I’m not sure if I’m being honest. I hope the BMA has plans, because honestly this is a much bigger issue than FPR. Actually in effect FPR probably further drives this issue as better pay means less people leave, and it’s more attractive to IMGs that will further up the competition for training numbers and saturate the locum market. (I’m still pro-FPR obviously just looking at it from a different angle 🦀). 
 What do people think the answer is?
 All specialities have points in their self scoring for home grad preference? Massive increase in training numbers highly unlikely to happen. Increased number of trust grade jobs? 
 I really don’t know.

I’m currently in a placeholder group in my original deanery and have heard a lot about trusts not getting funding/ wanting to find extra places etc. does anyone anecdotally know if people generally get jobs or if they know people who were approved but had to stay put?

                              <span>Unpopular opinion but I really think PAs are also victim in the whole situation and now that they are here, they exists, they have spent money, time and effort that they can never get back to get here, I feel that we should help to find a role for them to work with us. 
 A lot of the issue were raised regarding PA in primary care setting. Now that the government doesn&#x27;t want GP to issue fit note, why can&#x27;t this go to PAs instead? Extending fit note is such a tiring task on top of everything else. 
 What about going through clinic letters etc? Sure they can&#x27;t prescribe, but with their existing knowledge surely they can help aid us?
 Why can&#x27;t they discuss simple blood test results like Folate deficiency, or MSU that is positive in symptomatic patients on resistant empirical abx - - - which they can run through red flags of sepsis as per set protocol? 
 I really think there&#x27;s a place for PA to help us in primary care, and I really think we shouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on them. I&#x27;m sure a lot of them feel attacked, lied to, hopeless and I&#x27;m sure their mental health are severely affected.

                              <span>I know it varies but just looking for a rough idea. I was offered a phlebotomy job about 3 weeks ago, told they’d call back that week to confirm an offer with hours. Just got a call today where she confirmed the offer and said she would send my details to recruitment to start the process. 
 I haven’t been employed by the nhs before if that makes a difference. I did ask for a rough idea but she just said it depends how long everything takes. 
 I just want to know if it’s best to wait before I hand my notice in to my existing job (I would like a few weeks inbetween jobs if possible to do a driving course)

 Does anybody have a blue light card discount for Ocado that they don&#x27;t mind sharing with me? 
 I&#x27;m happy to offer any unidays or student beans discount codes in return.

                              <span>Finally have a start date for a position I interviewed for months ago. Was only waiting on occupational health, and they contaceted me today with a cancellation slot. Signed off without any adjustments needed, within an hour had my unconditional offer emailed and my manager was agreeing a start date! Funny how it takes months to get paperwork checked then an hour to get a start date lol Thankfully I&#x27;m being squeezed in before the 2nd so I&#x27;m on payroll and will actually get paid in May, very nice of my new manager to arrange.
 ​
 Any advice for a new starter? I&#x27;ll be admin staff on reception for A&amp;E specifically if that makes any difference, but general advice welcome!

 How should a candidate answer these questions for a B7 PM interview
 How will you make get different stakeholders on board in this role? - my approach is to talk about how I’ve managed challenging stakeholders but not sure it is the right approach 
 An example of when you have worked to address inequalities, either in patient or staff groups - my approach is to talk about when a team in an underserved area didn’t get the same equipments as one in other areas, but not sure it is the right approach. 
 Can someone help please with suggestions on how to answer these questions correctly.

                              <span>Hi, I asked my surgery for my summary care record and then I saw that I could get my detailed coded record on the nhs app, (I currently only have access to the minimum information).
 I just wanted to check, are these two separate things? The surgery sounded like my summary care record could take a while but I am wondering if getting the app access will be faster and if I should ask for that instead/as well. I don’t want to clog up my surgery with requests but I wanted to get the information asap as I think there might be some things I need to address and it seems like granting app access should be straightforward?

                              <span>What on Earth is happening with these wait times? Partner tripped down the stairs and her foot is swollen, 111 advised to call 999 and get an ambulance down. So we called them at 2am, we were told to wait downstairs near the front door, it&#x27;s been almost 5 hours and we&#x27;re still waiting! The swelling has got significantly worse but when we call we are just told the ambulance is on the way??

CT scan doesn’t give them the best picture told I need to wait here in hospital on MRI away from 1 year old and in pain each night. Most staff are just ignoring and i’m struggling so much. They said 5-10 days until mri can be done and feel that is :( non medical as just wanted to see if it sounds right that they wait so long on life threatening stuff

                              <span>My GP practice has made me aware that i have missed 4 appointments in the last 12 months and they said they were taking off their patient list, i tried to contest this on the grounds that i have severe mental health issues and have been asking for months for support with appointments etc. They won&#x27;t listen, anyway i got a letter from NHS and it states that the practice are removing me as in not in their catchment area. This is horrific as it isnt the truth at all, i live at the end of the street to the surgery and am indeed in the catchment area on looking into it further. My question is can they just do this and make up a random reason? As after tomorrow i have no GP. It has got my head all over.

                              <span>Looking for advice on getting an SAS / specialty doctor post in sexual health / GUM.
 I&#x27;m a GP by background (CCTed a few years ago), and have worked in a non clinical public health related job for the past year. I&#x27;ve got an interest in sexual health with a couple of previous GUM jobs during training and have done the DFSRH. A little out of date with it all now, but really enjoyed previous work in this area. 
 I&#x27;d really appreciate advice from anyone who has made the switch to a specialty (non-training grade) doctor in sexual health, either full-time or alongside GP. Particularly interested in how you ended up in this role, what level of experience is needed, and how I can improve my chances of getting a post. 
 If anyone is willing to have a chat or offer some advice on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>Coventry Gp training with 3 hospital rotations. 2 of which are Emergency medicine rotations in Warwick and UHcw. 
 Why 2 EM rotations ? It makes no sense. Almost all rotations taking you to 2,3,4 hospitals. 
 So dysfunctional.

 I’ve read the book, done some practice papers, all the online teaching stuff, but I’m terrified that I will fail. Any advice on what to focus on in terms of key exam questions/ scenarios that come up. 
 Thanks 🙏

 Recognising that anonymity is a common feature of many social media platforms the GMC states: 
  
&quot;9 Bear in mind that content uploaded anonymously can, in many cases, be traced back to its point of origin. When communicating privately, including using instant messaging services, messages or other communications in private groups may also become public. We have a legal duty to investigate any concerns raised to us that reach our fitness to practise threshold.&quot;

                              <span>This is more of a rant than a post, but does anyone else feel overwhelmed and just confused with emails of the pre-employment checks for GP training (or any other training post)? I&#x27;m due to start GP ST1 in August 24 and in the last two weeks have been sent over 10 emails with various links and various forms to fill in. I am grateful for the job and I feel like I shouldn&#x27;t complain about this but I&#x27;m just lost in a sea of HR words and documents and waffle!
 As a little summary of the things I&#x27;ve been sent:
 - A welcome letter, a privacy guide to sign, a guide about how to use the &#x27;TIS&#x27; system, had to make an account on the TIS system, then complete Form A/B of Form R on the TIS system, and a joining form, and remember to change my revalidation body on GMC website to my new education trust but only 7 days before I start the new job not earlier than that, and register with RCGP but only once I&#x27;ve done form R so then they can give me a training number which I then need to use on the RCGP application but it must only be for a training post, make sure I&#x27;m on the GP performers list, do a pre-health declaration form where I also need to find a life time history of my vaccinations, register for a TRAC account, sort out DBS etc etc etc ........... sigh 
 Each individual form takes me ages to fill in aswell because of poorly worded questions or tasks where I need to dig out previous evidence etc. 
 Does anyone else feel this way?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I was hoping to ask for advice regarding the inter foundation-school transfer appeals process. I applied for a transfer between F1 to F2, however this got rejected today. I wondered whether anyone had any advice on appealing. I applied under criteria 4. 
 Any advice would be appreciated - thank you so much!

 50% of the score for ST4 Psychiatry is dependent how you do compared to your peers in an OSCE-style exam which you can only sit once if passed.
 So scraped a pass? Never getting another chance at 25% of the total score.

                              <span>Hi guys! I hope you can shine some light on my dilemma. 
 I have recently been accepted for an MBA in a top business school with a 50% scholarship - which is still a big investment. For some context, I am an IMG doctor and I co-founded a startup in London after my foundation training which went well but never took off. Last year I decided that it was time to do something different and I applied for the MBA and took a Clinical Fellow post. During my Clinical fellow post (part-time) I rediscovered my passion for medicine and how nice it is to directly help people and I managed to get an IMT spot in the reserve list in an ok location. The MBA would give me a higher salary on a corporate job but it would take me away from medicine and I am not sure I am ready for it! I am thinking about declining or at least trying to defer the MBA offer to next year and do 1 year of IMT to see how I feel. Everyone that I spoke with told me that I would regret my choice and that I am romanticising medicine as I haven&#x27;t been full-time in a long time. 
 I want to hear your opinion on that, especially from doctors and consultants who like what they do. Is it that bad? What about when you become a consultant? Am I making the wrong decision?

                              <span>Well, I could not have expected this when I started off as a medical student nor at any time after I entered the Specialist Register. 
 Today I went to see one of my male in-patients on the psychiatric ward. He was previously informed that I would be seeing him at a certain time. I was then told that he was busy masturbating. I asked someone to ask him to clean up as I&#x27;ll be there in a few minutes, me thinking he&#x27;d be done by then. Minutes pass. I get to outside his room (door closed). Staff tell me &quot;He&#x27;s still at it.&quot; So I waited about 10 minutes outside of his room. Someone said I should knock and enter. I did not. I spoke with staff outside of his room for the 10 minutes. Then I had to depart for a meeting as I was now running late. He then opened the door to his room as I was about to depart and seemed to want to talk. I couldn&#x27;t as I was going to be late for the important meeting. I thought there was a funny side but off course said nothing of the sort. I breached no standard of practice as far as I am aware. 
 I am unable to reveal other details - and don&#x27;t ask why. I don&#x27;t know how staff knew he was still at it. 
 When one meets an unexpected first, one obviously wonders about what one would do if the situation presented itself again.

                              <span>Hi there, current FY2. I’ve received an interview date for an Oncology JCF job in a tertiary centre. I don’t have much oncology working experience but am very keen to gain experience and pursue it as a career. What sort of questions might they ask in the interview (specifically clinical scenarios) and what sort of resources have you guys used to prepare? Thanks for the help!

                              <span>Seems like a lot of people on this subreddit are very pro-CCT and flee, but was curious if most people expressing these views are ST4+? 
 Currently an ST1 and training&#x27;s been alright - it&#x27;s shielded from a lot of NHS bullshit, but you&#x27;re still working for the NHS. 
 Ophthalmology is switching to a new curriculum next year, but I&#x27;m skeptical this will significantly reduce training length. At the moment, I&#x27;m anticipating to CCT in probably 7-8 years after all of ST and ?fellowship assuming I stay 100% and pass all my exams/expected competencies in a reasonable time frame. 
 I know people have talked about going to Australia or the Middle East, but frankly I&#x27;m not that keen on the latter, and if everyone&#x27;s thinking of going to Australia or Canada after CCT-ing - what is the landscape even going to look like for me when I flee 8 years down the line? 😅 I do predict there will be healthcare shortages, but I would think locally, they&#x27;d also be looking to expand medical school/training places to accommodate in the next decade too. Is the prospect of CCT and flee as an ST1 even realistic?
 Also, I know ophthalmology is one of the more lucrative specialties, so surely there must be some barriers in place to emigrating vs a specialty that has a more supportive role (e.g. rads, anaes).

                              <span>I&#x27;m an F1, started in a new department a couple weeks ago. There&#x27;s a rule here that we aren&#x27;t allowed to take annual leave when the consultant in our subteam is on-call or post on-call (even if we are just working a normal day on the ward).
 Just wondering if there any rules proving this is a breach of our contract? Quite a few of my annual leave days have been/will be rejected because of this and its making it very difficult to plan time off/holidays to meet my friends :((
 Thank you!

Also wondering what everyone else thinks of the jobs for their preferencing :)

                              <span>Hi, my MSRA rank was 6900, and I haven’t received a job offer yet. I&#x27;m wondering if all the positions have been filled, or if we should wait for further job offers. Any idea what the rank and score were for the last person who received an offer? It&#x27;s quite overwhelming to prepare for the exam for the third time

                              <span>What are people’s experience and logistics of doing medicine after doing core anaesthetics to get into ICM? Is this something that gets organised for you once you have an ICM ST3 number? Would you be on a medical registrar rota? How does it all work? Is it a year of AIM or 6 months of AIM and 6 months ED?

                              <span>I’ve recently seen a chatbot built by a guy with zero medical background (on LinkedIn 💀) and tbf it’s not too bad. Not great, not good but not bad either. As an FY2 with plans to become a GP, I can see a future where pts are triaged or maybe even diagnosed automatically and I don’t know how I feel about it.

                              <span>Question regarding rota - I’m not a BMA member and my local junior doctor bma rep couldn’t help. I’m working 8-6 Thursday and Friday, 8-8:30 Saturday, 8-8 Sunday, bank holiday Monday, then 8-6 Tuesday - Friday. Does the bank holiday count as splitting up the shifts and therefore no zero day is needed? I have this on a couple of other occasions (working Thursday through to the following Friday, but without the bank holiday) and after raising this (for a few months), I’ve been given the Monday as a zero day to break up the 9-day stretch. However they are refusing to give a zero day on the week with a bank holiday. They also state because I moved the working weekend I’m not owed a zero day (I moved the weekend before they agreed to give me any zero days at all, so I’d argue if I cancel my swap I need my zero day, then reinstate the swap). Note, the working pattern given above is the original rotation (as if the weekend had not been swapped). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.
 Also, do the swaps also have to comply with rotation rules? Because I had no zero day to swap, where I’ve swapped my weekend to is now a 9-day stretch instead.

                              <span>F2 on Anaesthetics. I am horrible at this specialty. Have been ok with cannulas but three weeks in and have not managed an intubation successfully because I am either slow (because of fear of intubating the esophagus or damaging the teeth) or actually go down the wrong hole if I rush. Have attempted intubation under supervision like about 8-9 times so surely I should have had some success by now. I am ok with simpler airway things such as masking for pre-oxygenation and can get a good seal. And there’s so many wires and lines and I find myself struggle to follow simple instructions a lot of the times such as putting the brakes on the bed (I find myself thinking how do I even do this) or working the anaesthetic chart (I am scared of putting the wrong information such as doses as there’s so …</span>

                              <span>I received a job offer for CT1/2 non training role in one of the hospitals so far away from where I live. The job is excellent and will help me boost my portfolio, and perhaps I could use it to apply for ST3 plastics surgery. 
 I am not able to afford the cost of finding a new place (paying deposit and rent) as well as paying for my current rent as my contract is due to end in June. I have asked if the trust could help with the relocation and they said that unless you are post covers more three years or so, the trust won’t be able to support you with the relocation.
 I am expected to start as soon as possible and have already signed my contract.
 I asked them if they could advise me on what to do and have only received details of the real estate agents around the area. 
 I have also asked if I could postpone my start date and haven’t received any response yet
 I am worried that they will withdraw the offer 
 Would appreciate your input/ any suggestions regarding this

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be honest, this is my ONE holiday so I cbf going through MindTheBleeps sea of information. It would be so amazing if you could provide just a checklist of shit that I MUST know or else i&#x27;d be booted. I&#x27;m guessing stuff like ABCDE for Emergencies (tbh I have no clue how to even insert a nasal cannula for O2 and how to work a O2 tank fml). What else? 
 NB Baseline: I did extremely shit in Med school (multiple repeat years) but somehow eventually graduated. I am aiming to just not be kicked out of FY-1.

                              <span>Hi everyone I am a paediatric doctor who works in ED quite often. A regular attender 14y old YP with suicidal ideation few week ago called me a P**i behind my back and demanded they want a white doctor when I refused to discharge them without camhs assessment she was told off by the staff members apparently. I actually didn&#x27;t know about this until they represented again and they have an alert I look back at the clinical records documenting clearly they were racially abusive towards me. I didn&#x27;t have to see them this time as one of the other doctors offered to see them. However quite a few times I am the only available senior in the night shift. What are my rights here given the perpetrator is a minor. If they are not in life threatening situation can I refuse to see incase they present again and I am the only person available/ need to senior review?

                              <span>Please can any one explain to me what actually happened to Doctors pay. Other workers in the NHS are put on AFC which places them in bands. Nurses start as Band 5, physician associates start as Band 7 which makes them to currently earn more than FY doctors and some CT doctors. 
 I learnt that doctors chose not to be part of the AFC and chose a different pay structure. This made FY doctors&#x27; salary to be actually at Band 5 level where as If doctors were part of AFC they would have been placed to start atleast as Band 8A. So why are starting with a band 5 salary? 
 Is it better to go back to the AFC like other staff? Is the different pay structure wee are using now going to benefit us anytime soon? ( would things fall back in place soon) 
 I am actually confused.

                              <span>I will be starting IMT in August with rotations in Northumbria and Durham. I have tried getting information on groups, and I was disheartened to see Durham doesn&#x27;t have a good reputation. Is anyone working in acute/gastro in Durham? What are your opinions? I am planning to commute from Newcastle.
 Any accommodation advice that works for both hospitals for a single doctor? Where do doctors usually live in Newcastle? I would really appreciate your input.
 Thank you.

                              <span>We’re paid less for doing more work for no respect. Since being appointed as surgical SpR, I’ve repeated a year for “inadequate progress” after 6 months of bullying from a senior. My new boss is no better. All I do is read for work and study only to get comments highlighting what I don’t know after questioning. At ARCP they bring up the fact you’re not operating when consultants refuse to let you do anything. My friends in the private sector laugh at me for staying. The contract sucks. The way our colleagues are treated sucks. What’s the point any more?

                              <span>I recently pivoted and decided to apply for a competitive specialty which I hadn&#x27;t previously planned for. Luckily, I completed a QIP in this specialty previously but the consultant in-charge is hands-off and slow to reply. 
 Long story short, abstract submissions for the last conference I can find that would allow me to present this QIP prior to specialty applications closes soon. I have tried contacting the consultant and other senior involved many times to ask if they are happy for me to submit an abstract, but they are taking their time to reply (which isn&#x27;t unusual for them). It&#x27;s my fault because I&#x27;m scrambling to build my portfolio last minute.
 Presuming the consultant doesn&#x27;t reply to me in time, is it appropriate for me to submit the abstract at the last moment without their permission? 
 I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m over thinking it, but this is likely my last and only opportunity to present this QIP to make it count for specialty applications.
 Thank you so much in advance for your advice!!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m 41/m.
 I&#x27;ve attended a private clinic today for a consultation, which was initially for an umbilicoplasty, but the surgeon diagnosed it as an umbilical hernia. He&#x27;s told me it&#x27;s not particularly serious in itself, but there is a risk of complications developing in the future.
 The quote from the private clinic is £5000. I have already £1600 saved which was the quoted price of the umbilicoplasty, so to go ahead with this treatment would require me to find £3400 from somewhere.
 My employer doesn&#x27;t currently provide private health insurance, so if I took out a policy myself, I don&#x27;t know if this would cover it.
 I have searched for information regarding treating this on the NHS, but from what I can see unless there are actual symptons, this isn&#x27;t available - can anyone advise?
 Thanks

                              <span>Very quick question. I’ve got Hashimoto’s disease and been under endocrine for 2 years. I was taken off Levo early on being under the team. Discharged in Jan being told my thyroid is fine. I’m declining fast so out of curiosity asked for all my results from 2022 onwards. Had them sent to me noticed only my TSH was reported. 
 I went to my GP to ask for my thyroid panel to be done and she also cannot see any bloods for T4, T3 etc. Only TSH. She was really confused. 
 I’ve been fuming thinking this hasn’t been requested in two years but found a photo of two blood forms I had for 2023 all requesting full thyroid panel. In one of the matching dates to results even my TSH is missing…
 Can labs just not be done?

                              <span>I have been meaning to schedule an appointment with my GP for a clinical referral so I wanted to set up my NHS app. I confirmed my identification with a video reciting the four characters on screen. It has been eleven days since submitting this and I still haven&#x27;t had my ID confirmed? 
 I&#x27;m just curious if anyone else has had to wait for such a long time? On the official website it suggests that the ID would be checked within a few hours, which seems alarming as I hadn&#x27;t been provided with that information upon application.
 Many thanks,

                              <span>When it comes to lack of capacity (mental capacity act), information on this is in the area of mental illness very vague.
 I fully understand what lack of capacity is and common conditions involve brain injury, learning disabilities, dementia etc. I understand it involves a persons ability to make decisions, remember information long enough to make a decision, communicate their decision, and so on.
 But I’m specifically asking about mental health conditions and when and how they affect a persons capacity.
 I can’t seem to find any information online, except Schizophrenia and Bipolar commonly can affect a persons capacity.
 Can someone explain how certain mental health conditions can affect a persons capacity and deem them as having lack of capacity, not just conditions mentioned above.
 For example, I understand that when someone suffering severe Anorexia is at severe risk of harm they can be deemed as lacking mental capacity.
 But when does lack of mental health capacity apply to other mental illnesses, and what factors determine this? Like can someone suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder be such a risk that they would be deemed as lacking mental capacity, and if so, what behaviours would lead to this decision?

 Also, if I have two separate claims can I use one for one claim and one for the other claim?

 I am due to start my first job in Adult mental health (complex mental health issues) and I am fully aware of safeguarding procedures and protocols (infact, it’s something I take seriously as I suffered abuse growing up). I know any concerns about possible abuse have to be documented in full detail, as soon as possible, but one thing that is never mentioned or clearly defined is whether to openly ask a patient about regular bruising and injuries, or whether you just document your concerns after a session. 
 I am asking because I know someone who was in a domestic violence situation a few years ago and also at the time attending psychology therapy. She isn’t in that abusive situation anymore but at the time she was spoken to by (I think) adult…</span>

 I&#x27;ve explored doing the foundation degree in mental health, with a view towards Occupational Therapy eventually, but it seems my trust are not willing or able to fund it. It also takes me away from the lived experience aspect of my current role which is important to me and one of my main skills. But roles higher than a b3 in Peer Support/lived experience are hard to find too. 
 Does anyone have any advice at all?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a ward clerk that&#x27;s looking to join a union; not for any pressing matter, just given the political climate in the UK. The big 3 that get mentioned are Unison, Unite and GMB but the thing that&#x27;s making me hesitate about them is that Unison &amp; Unite seem to list every other hospital profession under the sun specificaly as staff they cater to but ward clerks are lumped into the &#x27;and other admin staff&#x27; category; and GMB seems to be workers in general with no specialisation. On one hand I get it, ward clerks are comparatively low in numbers compared to most other hospital roles, but on the other hand I want to know that a union will be looking out for us just as much as they do for the roles with big numbers.
 Open to any advice on which union might be best for ward clerks and if there&#x27;s any other unions to suggest please do.

I wanted input about what diagnosis is lacking data for our MVP of this product. Currently we are throwing around geriatrics, pregnancy, mental health, and chronic diseases. I would love the medical communities opinion on what would gain the most traction with customers for a medical API that provides medical standards.

                              <span>Recently I was in a diagnostic session with the consultant psychiatrist in my local NHS recovery team. My GP referred me to them for a PTSD diagnosis, CPA, talking therapies, and medication advice.
 I was taken aback during the latest session when the psychiatrist began really pushing me to look at going privately for talking therapies.
 I get that the NHS is crumbling - I work in the same NHS Trust - but it felt really wrong to me that an NHS professional should advocate for going against the founding principles of the NHS.
 Does anyone else feel that this is unethical?
 —
 Extra information: I have the distinct impression that the recovery service really doesn’t want to take me on because I need significant reasonable adjustments to their usual ways of working. My autism and ADHD impact my presentation of mental health symptoms, and I need lots of additional time to process emotions and information. The local IAPT straight up rejected me as ‘too complex,’ and told my GP to send me to recovery. But it feels that rather than adapt and adjust, recovery want to find any reason to reject me too.

                              <span>Most doctors work hand in hand with drug companies, so prefer to issue prescriptions. There seems to be a culture where by medical professionals are not allowed to express evidence led views which go against drug companies. 
 Example 1: 
 Bunion Repair
 Bunion repair by Bianchi, Italy or Harley Street &#x3D; No screw, 5 minute procedure, brilliant. No pharma company involved.
 Whilst Bianchi is a superior reoair, standard NHS bunion repair &#x3D; Invasive procedure using a purchased medical device (screw).
 Example 2:
 Inguinal hernia repair
 Desarda technique &#x3D; A strip of external oblique is stitched to inguinal ligaments and internal oblique. Wonderful natural muscle graft. 
 Whilst desarda is superior, NHS repair &#x3D; A piece of purchased polypropylene stitched into your abdominal wall. YUCK
 Example 3
 Heart stents &#x3D; Research shows that the vast majority of operations brought no benefit in stable patients. But the surgeries were arguable performed due to the stents being a medical product was being pushed and purchased. 
 Example 4
 Fasting. 
 The health benefits are endless. Reverse insulin resistance, autophagy etc etc
 Fasting doesn’t involve any prescriptions, so doesn’t seem to be recommended.
 How many GP’s/consultants prescribe a 10 day fast?
 
 I can go private and see doctors with views that differ from the masses. But are there NHS doctors out there that are able to have less than conventional views without being scalded.

                              <span>Hello all!
 Longtime lurker posting on a throwaway. 
 I&#x27;m an SHO grade doc working in Scotland just now. I was looking at ways to bolster my income and fell onto ear syringing. I have good experience in performing it, albeit not having attended any formal courses, and feel it&#x27;s relatively low risk as I intent to take a good history and ensure I&#x27;m not suctioning at a steatoma with my otoscope. A local dental practice I&#x27;m on good terms with (not my own dentist) have offered a chair a day a week to run a mini clinic. 
 Has anyone got experience in this market? I&#x27;ve been having difficulty finding any real info on indemnity around this. Most of the indemnity products I&#x27;ve found are aimed at companies/clinics with multiple practitioners. Further, does anyone know the situation with making the clinic compliant? I&#x27;ve read about needing CQC approval down south, but again, can&#x27;t find any info on Scotland. 
 Any input is welcome!

                              <span>I’m currently a CT1 in surgery and I’m four years into medicine. I’ve done nights regularly for three of the four years. I’m still disablingly scared of them, even if I’m actually OK on the actual stretch. My current job has quite a few nights but workload is generally okay, so my anxiety is not bad but it’s certainly problematic. I find myself trawling the ED track board for hours before my shift predicting who I might have to see or not. Advice is never too far away but I am so scared of appearing shit that I prepare and over prepare. There really is no point trying to predict referrals as I know what to do with most of them anyway, but it’s a compulsion I can’t stop. 
 My next rotation will be in a speciality I have little knowledge on, but I will be covering wards AND referrals overnight. I’m scared I’m going to perpetually be a wreck. I sometimes get fleeting thoughts of calling in sick so I don’t have to deal with it - I never, ever do, but it’s so tempting sometimes that I’m ashamed to say that sometimes the thought lingers a bit too long in my head. 
 It doesn’t help that my sleep is almost universally shit on them, and my eating isn’t much better. 
 Grateful for any help/tips/reassurance that this can pass, and I can trust myself a bit more.

                              <span>Thought I’d ask the hive mind! I’m applying for anaesthetic core training next year and would ideally like to be placed in either Oxford or Wales deanery. That said, I really want the Oxford University Hospitals rotation. I am just wondering how it all works. Am I able to apply to both and see which rotation I get before accepting my offer? Or is it deaneries first and then you choose your rotation and get allocated according to rank like the FY programme? I would take virtually anywhere in Wales tbh but if I knew for sure I’d been allocated OUH’s rotation in Thames Valley, I’d take that instead. Appreciate that this is all hypothetical and at the end of the day I’d take any post I get regardless but just wondering how it works. Thanks

                              <span>Yet another incoming FY1 here. Basically I have a 2 year gap between graduating and starting F1 in which I did nothing medicine-related. I feel like I&#x27;ve forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn&#x27;t that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don&#x27;t remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.
 Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO&#x27;s (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I&#x27;ve been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I&#x27;ve also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I&#x27;ve contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? 
 Just for a little more info: I’m starting on gen surg. Also I&#x27;m hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I&#x27;m honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I&#x27;m working a 9-5 office job which I&#x27;m looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. 
 Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I&#x27;m ready to put my best foot forward and I’m honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound. Thank you so much🙏

                              <span>Hi everyone, incoming fy1 here interested in physics, maths and engineering related specialties. What sort of pathway could I go down to explore these topics more in medicine? I understand radiology has a decent amount of physics and there’s certain specialties like nuclear medicine to consider, both of which interest me a lot. I am just wondering what other things I could be doing alongside going into these specialties that could get me into a field that has a decent balance of medicine and physics/engineering. I have considered PhD programs to do with biomedical engineering that might lend to a more academic career, or ones that I could do alongside my radiology training, would like to know more about this.
 Would love to know if anyone here has gone down such a route or if anyone knows anything about it. Thank you.

                              <span>A close family member living in the suburbs of London has a chronic health issue.
 I advised her to ask for GP specifically to plan referral.
 She filled in an online form then was called back by a ………BIOCHEMIST ……….who advised otc medication. 
 Fair enough introduced herself as such but ….. a biochemist- undifferentiated patients??????

 Is there any good resources that people know of as maybe a reference or something to read in my spare time that will help my clinical knowledge on paediatrics?
 I cover the wards, paeds ED, NICU and postnatal wards during this rotation.

                              <span>People ask me what I want to specialize in and I say Histopath with rads in close second and the first question they have is about AI and that diagnostic rads and histopath may become obsolete with AI. From what I have seen so far from tasters in both specialties, AI is nowhere near even replacing doctors in rads or path and the clinical context is super important when producing reports of either CT scans or reporting microscopic slides which I don’t see AI deal with the nuances of anytime soon. I get asked this question so much that I feel it probably may even end up being an interview question when I make my application. But at the same time because I get asked this question a lot (by other doctors), perhaps there is some truth to it?
 What do the radiologists and pathologists here have to say about this? Interested in hearing your thoughts.

                              <span>For context, I am not a consultant/GP, have been qualified and working as a doctor for 7 years. Will be keeping this vague for identifiability purposes.
 A friend of mine runs a food and drink business. They&#x27;re expanding to several other countries after some success in the UK, including the USA, Europe, and Asia.
 One of the regulatory bodies has different allergen standards (I.e. acceptable concentrations), which has highlighted some issues and changes they&#x27;ll have to make to sell some of their food there.
 They&#x27;re looking for a doctor to essentially take the info regarding some of these issues, collate some evidence around them, and sort of explain it all to the board of their company, and attempt to quantify some risks for them. Not to necessarily say &quot;this is medically fine&quot; or &quot;go full steam ahead with production&quot;, but more to explain some of the issues from a medical standpoint and the repercussions should something go wrong.
 Any risk would theoretically be covered by their indemnity and lawyers, and a document would be prepared stating that they&#x27;ve consulted a doctor for advice but that the company is entirely responsible and culpable for their own decisions
 My questions boil down to is this an acceptable thing to do? 
 I&#x27;m not an expert in any regard, and I&#x27;m still a junior doctor. They&#x27;re asking because we are friends is all.
 Is there anyone out there who&#x27;s done something similar for a company/in a commercial setting? Would it be bonkers to consider doing this (essentially it boils down to a literature review turned to lay language)? Would an indemnity provider like MDU have specialised cover for this sort of thing or?

                              <span>Hi everyone I am using a throwaway account as I do not want to be identified I am an incoming f1, rounding up the final bits of med school, elective on the way 
 I have been in a long term relationship throughout med school with my partner who I am now culturally/ traditionally married to. We just haven’t done a religious / white wedding yet . We were planning on doing this April 2025
 I have just found out I am pregnant. This was not planned and is coming as a total shock/surprise . Yes we did use contraception but as I have learnt these can also fail My husband is very supportive and I know he will be a great dad
 I am just very anxious about it all. I am wondering if starting f1 whilst pregnant is a good idea . I am a graduate student so having a baby was definitely a plan in the near future . Initially taking a year out after F1 or F2
 I am also worried on the financial strain this will put on my husband as by the time I am due I will not be entitled to the nhs maternity pay 
 I am just wondering if I should just postpone f1 to next year altogether? My due date at the moment is late December/ early Jan so I could technically finish the first rotation 
 Fy1 is already hard enough and I’m just worried I will not be able to cope.

                              <span>With everything going around the media and forums I’m at a crossroads - nearly finished training and getting on a bit age wise. 
 Probably going to complete training and leave the profession because I’ve realised that nothing will ever change no matter how hard I work and whatever I do to try to make the system better will just cause push back on me - so there’s no point. Have learnt this the hard way every year so far as a doctor - nobody wants improvement they only want to perpetuate the status quo and crush any challenge to authority or even open discussion. 
 The NHS can have its way and just employ under qualified robots to do it’s willing as per the way of the world these days. Maybe outsource healthcare to a call centre in India? Robot consultations as is the way in the USA. 
 Anyway - does anyone actually know a tradesperson earning £50-60k/y? I’d rather cut my losses and go back to college despite having postgrad degrees on top of medical training. 
 Has anyone successfully started a business like aesthetics or even non medical and made it succeed? 
 Is there any hope at all for the profession because I’m not hearing anything positive at all and it feels very much like the government don’t want or need doctors and in the UK the government IS the NHS. And the overseas market for UK doctors is saturated. 
 Do any senior doctors actually want to change the system? And do they understand what your junior ‘colleagues’ are going through (ie not just robots to do what you tell them but also thinking and intelligent humans wish to contribute)?

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to start F1 training in a small DGH. 
 Have been thinking about future career prospects and having done further reading, ophthalmology seems interesting. Problem comes with the fact I have done basically nothing in medical school other than pass my exams ☹️ (no awards/poster presentations). I realise and am willing to put in a lot of work during my foundation training. Question is: is it possible? And if so, where do I start?
 Would appreciate any help/advice that you guys can offer!

 Should I be feeling this insecure so close to the end? 
 Still find myself making silly mistakes, nothing untoward happening to the patients but still dumb mistakes/oversights that I catch later and spend the day ruminating about. 
 I get good feedback from juniors and consultants but I don’t think they tend to notice what I’m up to being a senior trainee.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the pleasure at working at many different hospitals. Which means I&#x27;ve worked with many different blood transfusion labs and feel that their approach to group and save samples is incredibly hard-line. 
 At this point, I&#x27;d like to point out I am very aware of what I&#x27;m asking for when I request a blood transfusion and I do have a genuine appreciation for the risks involved and for the potential for catastrophic mishaps.
 However, I&#x27;ve seen multiple occasions where samples have been rejected (often at the disservice of the patient) for extremely rigid rules that are completely inflexible. This leads to repeated stabs which are unpleasant for the patient or, at its worst, a delay in transfusion of cross matched blood. 
 What are your feelings on the threshold for rejecting G&amp;S samples?

                              <span>Offered a job in a hospital which has a lot of PA’s, reading the BMA advice ahead of time. In the BMA MAP scope, it says teaching is not to happen unless it falls within the safe parameters of working for MAPS. Does this mean things both within the green and orange boxes?
 For example, in psych, the green for MAPS is physical healthcare related only. So does this mean PA can teach related to performing a physical exam, but shouldn’t be teaching things like MSE/History taking? 
 Likewise, O&amp;G, orange box is refit or replace vaginal pessaries. Can they be teaching doctors how to do so?
 Has anyone been asked to arrange teaching programmes involving PA as educators and if so how have you organised this so it’s appropriate?

                              <span>Are there any enterprising prompt engineers on this sub? I’m trying to create a prompt that will reliably get ChatGPT to spit out somewhat reasonable reflections to pad out my portfolio with. The best I’ve managed to come up with is:
 “You are a medical doctor writing a reflective piece to include in your logbook. The case that you are reflecting on is [insert scenario] and the learning points that you want to take away are [insert learning points]. The reflective piece should be between 500-1000 words and should be based on the Gibbs reflective cycle. Keep a professional tone but inject some evidence of empathy throughout the text” 
 I’ve been getting middling results with this and was wondering if anyone has any pointers on how to improve the prompt? 
 Edit: totally on board with the responses about 500-1000 words being way too long. My initial plan was to just pad it with so much stuff nobody would bother reading it to be honest!

                              <span>I was assigned a community placement in psychiatry for my GP training. When I tried to get a fob to access the car park, I was told that because I&#x27;m only there for 4 months, I&#x27;m not eligible for a fob. When I asked the admin team where I was supposed to park, they told me to park on the roads nearby. The placement is in quite a deprived area, and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable parking on the roads a few minutes walk away. So I parked in the patients&#x27; car park a few times, and was issued a £100 fine.
 I ended up telling the consultant that I&#x27;m under about the whole situation, and he was very indignant about it. Sent an email to the admin team straightaway and I got a car park fob the next day. In hindsight, should have told the consultant about it a lot sooner.
 Just really nice to have your consultant stick up for you!

                              <span>Hi guys
 My current job has a 3 month notice period. I was just wondering, would I be put at a disadvantage if I were to apply for Medical Lab assistant role with a 3 month notice period? For example, someone might be able to start sooner. Is that taken into consideration? Of course this is assuming I did well in the application/interview and ticked all the boxes etc.
 I&#x27;m wondering whether to just hand in my notice period and start applying

                              <span>HI ,
 So about two months ago I contacted the cqc about the hospital i work in. They did a suprise visit about two months later ward is under threat of closure. The annoying thing that is despite this the same issues are still going on, when the cqc do a suprise visit do they have to give reasons as to why? and what prompts them to do suprise visits

 Please I&#x27;ll like to ask if there is a possibility of switching from the position of a healthcare support worker to an administrative role within the NHS. Thanks.

                              <span>I’ve been given two separate blood forms from two consultants, requesting for different things to be tested (one is some baseline stuff, the other is just for iron/ferritin).
 What happens if I take two blood forms into the blood centre? Will I need two vials of blood taken, or can the blood forms be “combined” somehow so everything is tested in one go?
 Sorry if this is a stupid question. I have a lot of anxiety around blood tests and it helps me a lot to know what to expect!

                              <span>Hi guys, I’m waiting for hemithyroidectomy since 12th Jan, I’ve been told by ENT doctor that it’s been put down as urgent (suspected cancer, biopsies were inconclusive, I have trouble breathing, swallowing etc.) and waiting time is up to 12 weeks. Well, it’s already been 12 weeks, I’ve got a “follow up” appointment booked for 3rd May, I’ve called them up and I’ve been told I haven’t been put down for any procedure in the system :) I’ve called them once before mid March and everything was fine, they just told me that I don’t have a date for the op yet and that’s it and now that. Does anyone know where can I complain or what can I do so they’ll actually get it together? It’s been months of stress and anxiety. Thanks in advance x

                              <span>Every time I am in the NHS system, at some point you are put into a holding pen of sorts at one stage. That is absolutely fine and I appreciate the NHS.
 However the simplest service step of just saying, &#x27;the wait will be about 30 minutes, you need to wait for the doctor&#x27;, or even &#x27;the wait could be 4 hours because we only have 1 ### but you need to be here in case we get you in earlier&#x27;. 
 People just want to know something, so they can relax. But you&#x27;re forced to awkwardly approach staff milling about and ask, which makes you look impatient. When you just want some idea of what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>Hi so I’m graduating from my Bsc in biomedical science this year, and I’ve applied to the STP for clinical neurophysiology. I was wondering what are my options to continue a career in neuroscience and get lab accredited if I don’t happen to get into the STP? I understand there’s always other masters courses without the clinical training aspect but I really want a career in the NHS and to work in healthcare. Also just fyi my Bsc is not an IBMS accredited degree so I don’t have any certification to work in a lab once I graduate. I feel like the STP is my best chance at kickstarting my career so I need to have a backup if it doesn’t work out this year. Please help!

 Please help us understand your views and experiences in relation to the role of Physician Associates (PAs) in general practice settings by completing our survey by Fri 10th May.
 The survey has been developed by the RCGP, following direction from RCGP Council, but is being conducted independently by Research by Design, an independent research agency.
 Your response will help us to understand more about how PAs are currently working in general practice as well as GP views on the benefits and challenges associated with this. We are also seeking your input on what framework and parameters should be in place to ensure that PAs working in general practice can do so safely and effectively, and what guidance is needed from RCGP.
 I know you&#x27;re all really busy, but the survey should only take 20–25 minutes to complete, and is really important, so please do take part if you can. We are keen to hear from as many members as possible to ensure we can gain a good understanding of views across the UK.

                              <span>Hello everyone! I was offered a GP post in chesterfield. Now that the ranking is open for the rotations, it’s quite confusing especially which GP surgeries to choose in that area. Also what are heft rotations like? Any inputs would be very much appreciated, thank you!

                              <span>Hello! My question is as above. We are an IMG couple and is my husband is applying to FY2 Standalone Program which will start this August 2024. I plan to apply for the 2nd round of GP training which will open on July and will start Feb. 2025. 
 Is it feasible that we both do this if we have a 5 year old child? And we will all be moving to the UK mid-July before FY2 starts. 
 I’m concerned regarding our schedule and it its feasible to manage being hands-on with our son or if it would be very busy and if its advisable I apply to GP training once my husband is done with FY2. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all. 
 A benign mass was found in my breast a few months ago but I’m really nervous as I feel like I’m being pushed toward surgery. 
 I’ve had appointments set for days I’ve informed the staff I can’t make, appointment times moved without consultation, and they want to make a 5cm incision on my breast (either around my nipple or near my armpit) but won’t tell me where they’re going to cut into me until after I’m under (I’m not a very big person that will be a significant portion of my breast). There’s been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I’ve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn’t use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I’m not even sure if I’m going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I’m really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the “usual surgery risks” (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). 
 I’ve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don’t have have savings as they’ve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can’t tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement. I’m incredibly anxious about this whole thing as I don’t really have a support network outside of my care team. If anyone could share their own experiences with breast clinics in the UK I would appreciate it.

                              <span>I (30sF) had a relationship for over 10 years with my ex (30sM) broke up 3 years ago.
 It ended badly. He took my home and my possessions. Cheated, was abusive. He sexually assaulted me. I didn&#x27;t report it, so no official complaint is logged.
 He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.
 Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.
 I soon moved because I didn&#x27;t want to be anywhere near him.
 He&#x27;s contacted friends asking where I am.
 My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex&#x27;s part of the hospital. My relative&#x27;s mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.
 My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn&#x27;t understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.
 My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he&#x27;d be far enough away and chances low.
 Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.
 More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.
 My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.
 I don&#x27;t know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.
 Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen? Could this help stop him continuing to contact my family using the hospital?
 Any help is much appreciated.

                              <span>Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks&#x27; time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.
 Near the top of the letter is a phone number to &#x27;reschedule or cancel&#x27;. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to &#x27;reschedule or cancel&#x27;, it seems reasonable that if I don&#x27;t contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there&#x27;s a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.
 I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do, so I figured I&#x27;d ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven&#x27;t been able to get through to anyone.
 So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I&#x27;m unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?
 I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I&#x27;ve been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I&#x27;m terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.
 Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).
 Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.

                              <span>I am an undergraduate psychology student who has an interview for a placement in the NHS. I am curious about the benefits of taking this placement as it is unpaid, and I am concerned whether the advantages (such as potentially securing a job more easily after university) outweigh the costs (such as increased university debt).
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, for a few years I&#x27;ve been having recurring abdominal pain, which seems to be chronic gastritis as I have all the symptoms.
 I first brought this up to my GP in 2022, which resulted in me taking prescribed omeprazole for 3 months. After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what&#x27;s causing my stomach pain.
 Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were &quot;inconclusive.&quot; I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.
 This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.
 This has been going on for years and I&#x27;m frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements. What can I do???

                              <span>Is it even possible to get my full medical history from birth? I recently downloaded the NHS app &amp; it shows which medication I am on, but it&#x27;s not showing my medical condition! Which I&#x27;ve had since birth, it&#x27;s not showing on the NHS app! I&#x27;ve been at my current doctors for 5 years &amp; they&#x27;re aware of my medical history. It says medical Condition 0. 
 I asked my doctors &amp; they asked me to put it in writing which I did. Does anyone know how long it will take to get my full medical history from birth if possible? Because I was really sick as a child. My mum told me had different medical issues which I later found out I didn&#x27;t. thank you.
 Thank you to everyone. I have my medical records now. 163 pages.

 My first day of being in this team I was told by my line manager that they didn’t really see a place for me and that they’d help me create a CV for another job. 
 Am I wrong in being upset about this?

 It seems GP across the country is in a dire situation, but I have been told it is &quot;better&quot; in London. 
 For fully qualified GP&#x27;s who are and have been working in London...
 How is it? 
 Is it sustainable? 
 Are there more &quot;opportunities&quot;, private or otherwise? 
 Do you get paid (alot) more in London? 
 Are there more partnership opportunities? How about getting into other industries such as branching into health tech / pharma? 
 Or perhaps going into more public health / regulation / policy? 
 For those outside of London, is it as bad as the press says it is? GPs going to food banks, or going to 
 I think the recent issues in GP have been making me strongly consider whether to remain in training or leave to enter a different speciality. 
 I figured getting some objective truth / advice from fellow GPs on here would be helpful.

                              <span>Hi all am a bit stuck with delays getting onto the performers list and having a nightmare with PCSE, would appreciate some advice about how I can try and get it sorted asap. I’m UK trained and CCT’d in Feb 2024. I hadn’t been told re: being on the PL as a registrar so tried to apply as qualified since mid January. Initially PCSE website was down so couldn’t do it, then my account got frozen and unusable, it took 6 weeks of emails and phone calls for them to sort. I finally got application put through and have been waiting another few weeks since. All this while, I managed to get a job on OOH bank contract but am being told I’m not allowed to take any work with them until on PL. I’m also concerned if this drags on further they’ll terminate my contract. I engaged BMA before but hasn’t seemed to help. I’m now almost 3 months post CCT and it’s causing me loss of income- I’ve drawn on savings for mortgage etc but the whole thing has impacted my finances and I’m pretty angry. Any help/advice much appreciated sorry if this comes across as ranty!

                              <span>Hi all, i am a gp ( recent cct). I love to travel , it’s something I truly enjoy doing. I am currently in Japan and have been here for the past 3 months, absolutely love the people and the culture, and planning to travel for least 12 months. I don’t want to keep coming back to uk and locuming for a couple of weeks and heading out again. Then it hit me , why not work remotely using a VPN . There must be way right, I mean we are living in 2024 not 1980, the world is so connected now. I heard that indemnity can be a headache ? I don’t understand why tho. What’s the difference between speaking to a patient in Japan as opposed to in my living room , if makes no sense to me. Has anyone done this ? Would really like to hear your thoughts. Thanks all 🙏

 I always think about the paramedic who informed me that my Mum had passed away, many years ago. She died in a very upsetting and traumatic way, and from what I understand, the visual would have been really upsetting. I did not see her. 
 I always think of him and I wonder what kind of support he would have been given. Is there an official process? Is there mandatory counselling given after incidents like this? 
 Thank you in advance, and apologies for the morbid question.

                              <span>I have a medical exemption card. When I went to get a prescription earlier, they said ‘and you have a pre-paid certificate right?’ And I said ‘no I have a medical exemption’ and they looked puzzled and said they have me down as pre-paid certificate. I showed my card, they then entered the correct type and all was fine. 
 What has now worried me is I’ve collected prescriptions a couple of times from here previously, one last week and one in January. I’m pretty sure I showed my card then or said I had a medical exemption. Any chance they wrote down the wrong type at one point and now that’s stored on my file? Could I get penalised by the NHS BSA if it looks like l’ve claimed on this when I haven’t? Maybe they’d see if I have a medical exemption and it’d be ok, but not sure how their checking system works. 
 I will go into the pharmacy tomorrow just to check with them, but thought I’d ask on here as it’s causing a little anxiety. Thank you

                              <span>Hi all
 Accepted on upcoming Aug entry to GPST. I already have my locality.
 I&#x27;m looking to get a mortgage. The broker says they need a contract prior to AIP/offer. Does anyone have past experience with when we would receive an offer (I&#x27;d imagine it might be very late) or any other advice regarding this.
 I would imagine even the specialist brokers for doctors would require a contract.
 Thank you

I’ve had only one primary case placement in my training so far, which was an honest nightmare (only enjoyable bit was the patient consultations, I used to dread interacting with the team- they were rude, easily irritable and honestly seemed like not coping with the workload themself which kinda was being taken out on trainees). I was at a point where I questioning my decision to be in GP training. Thanks to the weekly teaching group sessions at the time, I could understand that experience can vary greatly between practices and therefore decided it would be sensible to stay on to see how things go in my next primary care rotation.

                              <span>Everyone here will have worked in a hospital rotation of some sort. How many times do you hear the patient say “oh I went to my GP who told me to come in”. Everyone rolls their eyes at the silly GP sending people in because they’re lazy
 When you speak to the patient, a good proportion won’t have actually seen a doctor: - Some of them went to their practice nurse for a routine checkup - Some of them went to one of the PA or ACPs - Some of them called up their GP and couldn’t get past the “go to A&amp;E if you think it’s an emergency”
 Anyone else noticed this/got any thoughts? You never actually went to your GP, but it all gets lumped together as “why has their GP sent them in for THAT?!?!l 
 (Obviously goes without saying that shit and/or GPs exist, and everyone’s guilty of an embarrassing referral)

                              <span>Hi all. Wanted to get thoughts from people.
 I&#x27;m entering GP training in August. I really wanted an A&amp;E rotation as I want to work in A&amp;E occasionally as a GP. I&#x27;m interested in managing minor injuries, suturing, procedures etc. I know a lot of this is done by non doctors but I wanted to build up experience so I can do a lot of OOH work as a GP. However, I didn&#x27;t get my chosen ED rotation as there were only 3 to choose from...
 Does this limit my ability once I&#x27;m qualified if I wanted to spend a decent amount of time in ED as a GP?

                              <span>Hi I am not sure if I understood everything completely, that&#x27;s why I am writing this post. I hope someone correct me if I am wrong. I have seen that the fill rate for GP training for the previous years was always less than 100%. Does that mean that there are always unoccupied posts? If this is true, it means that an applicant can get an offer even if his MSRA score is very low

 I’ve accepted my GP offer at Stepping Hill and have been asked to rank GP practices in Stockport. 
 Does anyone have any experience of working at these GP practices? If so, which ones would you rank top 5 and which ones to avoid and why?
 Thank you in advance :)

                              <span>I am a GPST1, relatively de-skilled re asthma management and COPD as we have respiratory nurses that do the most of it. 
 ​
 I got confused re-dosages, escalation policy and when to use what 
 Nice/BTS/GINA State different things and dosages : so my questions are 
 ​
 -Any simplified escalation policy including dosages involved? 
 -Maximal dose of steroid per day (GINA states 2000, BTS/NICE 1000) 
 -Maximal dose of LABA. It&#x27;s officially 46 for Formoterol, but saw patients using more. 
 -What do you give if patient is on Fostair and reached 8 puffs a day (&#x3D;maximal dose of Formoterol 46mcg) and you wish to increase his inhaled steroids 
 -role of muntelukast in this story 
 -role of anti histamins (as resp nurses gives it at times as well) 
 -would you give combined LABA+Steroid(e.g. fostair) and also reliever therapy as salbutamol of not well controlled on maximal dose?
 ​
 Your help is IMMENSLY appreciated!

                              <span>I know this question has been asked a few times before, but what’s the best courses I can attend as a GPST? My current region is quite generous with their allocation so I’m hoping to make the most of the budget. I’ve done PCDS dermoscopy which was very useful and enjoyable.
 Also if there’s any that are not only useful but also CV boosters that would help too!

                              <span>A new oral vaccine for cholera has received prequalification by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 April. The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. 
“The new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. “The new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.”
WHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S.  
Vaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.  
There were 473 000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</span>

                              <span>Hear me out. My practice PC can barely run more than S1/AccuRx and a few chrome tabs (or one NHS Mail tab). If I try to open a PDF it&#x27;s russian roulette whether or not my screen will hang, and don&#x27;t even get me started on the arachaic Word referral doc system we still have going because that&#x27;s another rant in itself...
 I looked at &quot;My Computer&quot; the other day and saw that the PC I use has 8GB RAM. My iPhone has 6GB of RAM and all I use that for is reddit and ignoring my emails, but I digress.
 I found this the other day. An 8GB RAM upgrade for the PC I&#x27;m using. This would double my RAM, quadrouple my productivity and probably cure the viral URTI of the patient sitting in front of me if it tried hard enough - and all for the low, low price of £16.94.
 So tell me, someone, anyone, please, why shouldn&#x27;t I just purchase this and install it onto my practice PC? It would cost me less than a nice take-out dinner and serve me righteously for years to come!
 (PS: Do you think I would have to run this by the IT guy or do you think it&#x27;s cool if I just open &#x27;er up and giv&#x27;r? Srs answers only plz.)

                              <span>Hello GPs and supervisors, 
 I am currently GPST2 who is starting a placement at a UTC where there’s basically no GPs and obviously no GP trainers. It’s completely run by allied health care professionals. There’s a GP on-call remotely for advice and that’s all. 
 My question is: am I ok with working with no supervision? As per my understanding and the NHSE policy; GP trainees are to be supervised at all times when in GP practice. I don’t know if it’s the same with UTCs. 
 Advice and course of action appreciated.
