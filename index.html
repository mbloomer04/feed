                              <span>Hello, quick question. Is it common for NHS jobs adverts (at nhsjobs and tracjobs) to be closed many days before the stated deadline? I tried to apply for a job that was posted on day X stating that the deadline was for day X+13, and the application was closed on day X+2.
 P.S. I know they have the right to do so, but I read that they are obligated to state on the job offer that should the maximum number of applications be reached, the advert will be closed, which was not the case for me (I came across a couple of other job offers who stated so and I rushed to apply).

 One of the questions is asking for post type or appointment. The options are LAT, Military, Substantive and Visitor. Which one do I pick? Is IMT classed as Substantive.

                              <span>I’m a CT1 in psychiatry, a friend of mine tends to complain about psychiatrists all the time. And I can feel that she feels distasteful about me ever since I’ve started in Psych. 
 I love Psychiatry, and I want to continue doing it. But even in the hospitals I have noticed that our patients are not very fond of us, most of dislike us. Which to me is understandable, since we section them, give them depots. 
 After this I made a mistake of looking it up online- why do people hate psychiatrists, and I found so much hate. 
 This makes me miss my rotations in medicine, because I felt more appreciated and rewarded by the patients. However, in psychiatry it’s just soo common to go through racial abuse, verbal abuse, threats, and I can go on and on.
 I don’t know, what is your take on it? Will appreciate some opinions on this, as again I feel very passionate about it, but all this hate is getting to me.

I have just got access to my nhs app and seen from last year that although my gp said no further action my ferritin and folate are very low. The just fall into range but from everything I have read online it is far to low. Is it worth getting another test through the nhs? Or should I just go private ( cost depending) We have a family history of b12 deficiency and anemia.

                              <span>I currently have a job offer with an NHS trust, and I was told a week ago that my CoS is still being processed (waiting for 1.5 months now) and I was asked for further docs (IELTS, TB docs, proof of funds, etc which are technically visa requirements, but I complied anyway). I have applied for this opening via trac jobs.
 However, I&#x27;ve been contacted by certain recruiters on linkedin in the past few days, offering to discuss opportunities they have with the NHS. I&#x27;ve told them that I have an offer, and that the CoS is currently being processed. Then they&#x27;ve begun offering the possibility of quicker processing and deployment. They&#x27;ve also asked me to send them my CV, which I have not done as of writing.
 Is it possible at all for legitimate NHS recruitment/application to be done outside trac? Moreover, with the recent change in immigration policies, how can they guarantee people with quicker processing times?

                              <span>They recommended me some exercises for my issue. I asked if they could tell me which ones and they just told me to google it and that I&#x27;d find something.
 They certainly didn&#x27;t seem pressed for time, so I&#x27;m not sure why they couldn&#x27;t have demonstrated them or at least printed some out for me? Is this really something I need to go private for or is the NHS actually of some utility here?

 I’m on a standard training programme, now ST3 with AKT and SCA passed, portfolio completed and support from ES to CCT. However, my CCT date is set at Dec 24. Is there any way to reduce it?

                              <span>Scotland - Social worker contacted me today explaining that they would require lots of section 47 forms for all those patients who got carer help with medication . Apparently the Care inspectorate is coming round and without such forms SW will be in big trouble. 
 I comforted them with explaining that I will be standing with them in commiseration but certainly would not entertain issuing section 47 forms to capacitous adults who make a decision to seek help from carers.
 I did have a few months ago a conversation with the mental welfare commission who was very clear that asking for help with eg tablet counting, assembling of doses or even asking for complete taking over of sorting the meds is entirely compatible with having capacity. 
 SW is of course heart broken about my attitude. 
 Any useful thoughts?

 Hide the weighing scale before you start any session. If you locum arrive at least 10 minutes before, locate that thing and put it in the cupboard/out the window/in the bin. 
 Me at least twice a day:
 ‘Madam, please step off the scales. You came here so I could diagnose your child with threadworm. It’s not an opportunity for you to check how much weight you’ve put on over the past year…’

                              <span>Hi,
 This may possibly be a silly question. I&#x27;m a current GPST3 eyeing up options for work after qualifying.
 Is it possible to work at two different practices as a salaried GP at both? E.g. Monday Tuesday at practice A, Wednesday Thursday at practice B?
 Would this break any rules? Would it have any negative implications for tax purposes or NHS pension?

I have just been charged another £291 in April (probably the start of their financial tax year). I thought they would charge me again when I start ST2 in Feb 25.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I am new GP partner, early 30&#x27;s and wondering what others are doing for pension. Considering as a GP partner you have to contribute employees contribution and the 2015 scheme penalises for you retiring early, are many people using a SIPP instead?

 Thanks for looking after this patient in their 80s recently. Your discharge letter says “lansoprazole withheld, GP to review”. There is no mention of why this was done. there is no drop in kidney eGFR. They have been taking it for many years with no issues. There was a slight brief drop in sodium on admission bloods I see- but many things could cause this. Can you tell me why stopped please?”

 A&amp;G letter to hospital. 
 “Dear team. 
 Famotidine costs the NHS £38 a month so that’s 44 x the expense of lansoprazole or £457 a year. We do try to save money sometimes, in primary care at least. 
 Regardless of this, I issued the medication as instructed and they tried it out.
 It has not worked. The family fed…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never done a publication but need one or two - subject, quality and impact factor is not really important. Does the hive mind have any suggestions on quick/easy wins for publications? I&#x27;m a jobbing GP (salaried). Did a boring audit on bisphosphonates prescribing recently (pts on then &gt;5 yrs), boring audit on patients started on frusi without a BNP.

                              <span>I am grateful enough to have got an NTN for ST3 in a highly competitive surgical specialty.
 However, it is far from my partner and my family. Partner has her own work and it&#x27;s now dawning upon us that the move may not be that easy.
 I have seen the form on ORIEL whereby you can reapply to continue your training in another region whereby you continue at ST4. In essence, you reapply in open competition with the only difference being you have to upload a form with your current TPD supporting your application.
 My issue now is, is it worth doing this? The application window for the speciality basically opens up at the same time I start ST3 in October. Does it look bad approaching TPD to ask him to sign the form at the start of my training? Will he think badly of this. And say I am not successful in reapplying, will the current TPD then screw me over for the rest of my rotations thinking this person didn&#x27;t even want to be here in the first place?
 Some of my friends are saying it&#x27;s worth reapplying in open competition whilst retaining my NTN. But I am scared if I don&#x27;t get in, I will set off on a bad foot with the TPD of the current region which I would then be stuck in for the rest of my training. I don&#x27;t know how TPDs respond to this

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently a GPST2 trainee. 
 I had a close friend who is 8 weeks pregnant approach me on a weekend to ask if I would be able to prescribe some cyclizine.
 She was feeling nauseous, able to tolerate most oral intake with some small amount of vomiting. Background of hyperemesis.
 There were no GP appointments the day before and 111 didn&#x27;t get back to her so she was lost on a weekend.
 Has anyone been in this situation before?
 Looking online, it seems that it&#x27;s legal but &quot;frowned upon&quot; unless it&#x27;s an &quot;emergency not convenience&quot;?
 Would appreciate any input.

                              <span>Possibly a stupid question, but I’m wondering how possible it is to get into Anaesthetics CT/ACCS straight out of FY2 these days? I’m aware that absolutely smashing the MSRA to land an interview is paramount.
 I’m an incoming FY1 but I’ve had a 2 year gap since graduating, which was necessary for health reasons. I’ve got an anaesthetics rotation third and I also plan to arrange a taster week. Does anyone have any tips on how to make the most of these, and how to make the most out of FY1 in general? Have read that audits, teaching, attending relevant events and having achievements outside of medicine are important for portfolio/interview purposes. I don’t have anything in the way of SSC/elective from med school, no distinctions/merits etc (I was a bit of a pathetic student ngl, but I’m read…</span>

                              <span>Hello. My name has roots in a language that&#x27;s quite different from English. People who don&#x27;t know this language can&#x27;t pronounce my name correctly not because it’s hard to pronounce but because they read it literally. It&#x27;s like how the Slovak name &quot;Jana&quot; would be pronounced &quot;Yana&quot; in English. Up until now, I never corrected my colleagues and patients to pronounce my name as it&#x27;s spelled, but that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s really pronounced, and I wonder whether I should start correcting them (as I am starting to feel a bit uncomfortable). People don’t get my name right at first attempt, and when my colleagues are present, they often correct my pronunciation of my name (me: “I’m Jana” … someone “sorry what’s your name again?” … my colleague “Yana”… someone “Ah okay I got it! Nice to meet you, Yana”) 
 Would it be too complicated to introduce myself by saying, &quot;The spelling is Jana, but the pronunciation is Yana&quot;? Should I change the spelling on my yellow badge to match the pronunciation (“Yana”)? What do other people in similar situations do? Should I accept how others call me so as not to complicate my life?

                              <span>13hr shift with a fairly heavy take on acute medicine yesterday, everyone was pushing themselves to keep the flow going and shift as many to the wards as we could manage.
 We got sidetracked about 3am. A 24yo woman presented with soft tissue injuries and dislocated shoulder, with a weekly alcohol intake of 34 units. Audit-C score was 7, but CIWA-A was only 1. No symptoms of AWS. A dispute started between the F1 doing the clerking and the bay nurse, about whether she needed immediate benzodiazepine treatment to prevent withdrawal seizures.
 It escalated in a ridiculous way to include the registrar on duty, then the charge nurse, then the ward sister. Their position was that we should give the full protocol, ours was that she&#x27;d been assessed at low risk and wasn&#x27;t dependent. The charge nurse started threatening &#x27;Datix for patient safety&#x27; and trying to strongarm the F1 into prescribing.
 The argument ended when the professor in charge of the take wandered towards the noise we were making. He listened for a minute, flicked through the patient notes briefly, glanced at the numbers, then turned to the charge nurse. &quot;My alcohol intake&#x27;s higher than that, where&#x27;s my benzodiazepines?&quot; Held out his hand and started making &#x27;gimme&#x27; gestures. No response.
 Long story short, we stopped being asked to prescribe the meds.

                              <span>Unfortunately I am having to move to an area I’m unfamiliar with and the current options are to live alone or with other F1s. I really love the idea of having my own space and am currently thinking of renting alone but also concerned about feeling isolated living in a new area with no support system nearby. Just wondering how people found living alone/with others during your foundation years and what you’d recommend?

 In a nutshell:
 30 year old medic very much of the academic and conscientious but under-confident and unassertive variety. I found foundation training stressful and it basically took over my life for 2 years. I then did a series of locum jobs. The only time I ever really enjoyed medicine was when I had a 9-5 locum gig in an old age psychiatry unit with not much responsibility... I realise I have a lot of anxiety about on-calls and that my day-to-day mood is pretty much predicted by how close a set of nights or weekends or long days are.
 I applied for GP training as I quite like GP (but with 30 minute F2 appointments!) and was worried about my foundation competencies expiring. I then fell pregnant and deferred the job. My baby i…</span>

                              <span>I’m a GPST3 and started in Aug 2023. I CCT in Nov 2024.
 I dropped down to 80% LTFT for GPST3.
 Can someone pls tell me how many days of AL including BHs I’m supposed to have from Aug 2023 to Nov 2024? 😭 I’m at the same practice the whole way through if that changes anything.
 I’m confused about what my entitlements are. I started F1 in Aug 2019 so I will hit 5 years of service on 7th Aug 2024.
 Thank you

 They go “what bottle necks? Unless you’re some kind of idiot, it shouldn’t be hard to jump through their hoop games”.
 Maybe this sub always echoes negative experiences the most, but I don’t think I was wrong in saying there definitely are bottlenecks lol. 
 Didn’t like 300 qualified anaesthetics trainees fail to go into ST3 or 4 (sry i forgot the official statistic) because the government refuses to create more training places?
 Just thought it was an odd conversation, wanted to share.

I&#x27;ve had very lovely feedback on my TABs/MSFs in the past but I think this is the first time someone has gone to the trouble of finding out who my supervisor is so they could send positive feedback about me.

                              <span>Hi everyone, hope you’re all well. 
 I’ve just been told that my IMT1 Neurorehabilitation post has been swapped to Resp/Palliative care - which is fine but I want to do Neurology (and neurorehab was my only Neuro based post) in the future and am now worrying this will impact on my ST3 applications? 
 I’ve emailed to see if the post could be swapped to a more Neurology-focussed post, but unfortunately apparently there aren’t any more options available at the moment - they’ve said they’ll let me know. 
 Just wondering what my options might be for this? And if it will impact on speciality applications in the future? 
 Would appreciate any advice! 
 Thank you

I&#x27;m about to lose the house due to it all (finding a house was really difficult because I have cats, and no getting rid of them isn&#x27;t an option, and no I don&#x27;t have family to fall back on). The deanery won&#x27;t provide me a reference because they said it&#x27;s up to the trusts, and I&#x27;m placed across two different trusts, to make matters more difficult. None of them are able to help and provide me with a generic reference stating basic FY1 salary yet. Has anyone experienced this, has anyone got any advice about how I can get it resolved? Really freaking out about having nowhere to live. Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering throwing in the towel on medicine. Training in the UK is increasingly becoming incompatible with my life aims (yes, more so than they were before). Throughout medical school I wanted to be a psychiatrist, it was the area I was always most passionate about and genuinely exceeded at, whereas I was a very underachieving student elsewise.
 I can&#x27;t help but feel a degree of resentment to those who are applying to psych despite likely having no actual specific interest in the field. This is undoubtedly selfish, but I feel like my field of passion has practically been stripped away from me, as I&#x27;m only able to work in a very specific area of the country due to family commitments. 
 I&#x27;m stuck locuming with the threat of redundancy looming over me, and honestly I&#x27;m spending half my time in a state of anxiety and uncertainty.
 I&#x27;m wondering whether it might be time to get off the medicine wagon and give myself space to breath and retrain as a Psychotherapist.
 Would this be a practical move?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I received superb, expert, compassionate and life-improving care from my local eye hospital. I suffered eye trauma in a freak accident, and thanks to your colleagues I&#x27;ve gone from a traumatic cataract, &gt;60 intra-ocular pressure and other assorted grievances to successful surgery, dramatically improved vision and a low, manageable risk of glaucoma. 
 I want to thank the brilliant people who helped me, in a way that gives them the recognition they deserve from the brass! No doubt they&#x27;ll have handled much more serious matters than mine, but this was a scary episode nonetheless. Their skill and compassion made me feel safe - a profoundly valuable thing at a time of vulnerability. 
 I gather that an email to PALS helps with the portfolio. What I&#x27;d like to know specifically: 
  
Will a single email about everyone suffice? I don&#x27;t remember everyone&#x27;s name (I was seen by a lot of people), but should be able to provide enough identifying info. 
 Will the brass read it?
 Will it be seen by the people themselves? On a personal level, I&#x27;d like them to know just how much I appreciate them.
 
 A couple of nuggets stand out: 
  
The doctor in A&amp;E who calmed me and made me laugh when I was freaking out about my 60+ IOP, and who also had the humility to say that she had to check what to do with the glaucoma consultant. Knowing what you don&#x27;t know and admitting it is surely the most noble form of intelligence. 
 The consultant herself. I suppose we expect consultants to be expert and decisive (she was both), but she was also approachable, attentive and friendly over multiple appointments. 
  
It occurs to me that bedside manner is more memorable to patients than hard-earned clinical skill. Perhaps that&#x27;s just because we understand it better. Anyway, it stays with you, and I salute you all for retaining your humanity in a society that under-values you. 
 Sorry for banging on. All insights into what&#x27;s best for your colleagues are welcome!

                              <span>FY1 rotated onto surgery (3 weeks ago) after 8 months of medicine.
 I&#x27;ve noticed over the last couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been feeling a bit down. Struggling to be present, a little more anxious, and just not as happy.
 Only made the realisation today that a big part of it will be unfulfillment at work. On medicine I was seeing patients independently, having good relationships with seniors, and feeling like a valued member of the medical team. On surgery, the seniors haven&#x27;t even bothered to learn my name, I am not using my clinical brain whatsoever, and I spend all day doing ward jobs.
 I don&#x27;t want to feel like this for the next 3.5 months. I don&#x27;t dread going in and when I&#x27;m in I am not having overtly bad days, but I&#x27;m just not enjoying life as much. Does anyone have any tips, inside or outside of work, for dealing with this?

                              <span>GPST rotating in Medicine.
 Received no induction for this post.
 Had a look at the rota when I received it 8 weeks ago, it showed I was working 8-5pm on the 1st May Bank Holiday. Nothing on the rota showed I would be specifically be working. I spoke to my fellow GP colleagues who said it would be an off day as I&#x27;m not oncall. No word from the rota coordinator regarding this either.
 Now the rota has changed to show I&#x27;m working an acute ward 8-5 on that day. I&#x27;ve already booked my tickets abroad and it will be expensive to change. 
 How should I approach this?

                              <span>Hello from across the world! I am a final year medical student from Australia (postgrad), who recently did an elective in London - I loved the city and would love to live there for a portion of time.
 I know things in the NHS are bleak, but wondering if anyone has any experience coming from Australia to the NHS temporarily? The proximity to europe is a big selling point.
 Not sure what stage of my career/UK training this would be possible, I’ve seen the posts around locum positions being harder to come by etc. In Australia we will now have a 2 year internship system (similar to F1/F2), and people will generally work in HMO/SRMO/unaccredited registrar jobs whilst trying to get onto training (can be many years depending on specialty).
 I know people often move internationally for fellowships, however with how long specialty training now takes in Australia, I would likely be mid to late 30s by that point and children makes things harder.

                              <span>Hello kind friends!
 I will be moving to the UK from Oz at the end of the year to start a Clinical Research Fellow job in London. By that point I will have GMC registration as a specialist (neurology).
 I had heard from seniors who did similar work in the UK many years ago that they supplemented their income by doing clinics on some weekends where they saw patients who are basically on a backlog waiting to be seen by specialists in a public clinic. I was wondering if this is still a thing nowadays and how feasible it is to pursue this for supplemental income and what the logistics may be to seek out this type of work?

                              <span>Why is there so little respect for EM as a specialism amongst specialties? We are at the hospital generalists at the sharp end and can deal with all emergencies in all specialisms and have a broad but limited knowledge of all specialisms. We hand you patients with undifferentiated pathology wrapped up in a bow and yet you still reject appropriate referrals and manage to complain to no end. We see three times as many patients and discharge two thirds. An acute medic can’t manage croup in a child and an orthopod can’t manage ACS. We can manage all cases and filter undifferentiated pathology

                              <span>Good Morning All,
 First time poster here so be gentle. Been doing F3 and F4 locums via an agency (will keep their name off here) and have spoken to one of my colleagues about the use of umbrella companies. He has informed me that he uses the same company and is getting full take home pay and is sorting out his taxes with his accountants. He has said he has been happy with this arrangement but has recently found out through 2 different agency staff that used to work at this company that they where actually not paying the VAT and the agency staff would take a fixed percentage of this on a weekly basis in forms of a bonus from the &quot;umbrella company&quot;. 
 I was shocked by this and have spoken to a few agencies about this and been advised that there is only two companies that allow this practise and I am shocked and appalled by this. I&#x27;ve calculated it to be that some people can be making £2000 per week from their locum doctors. I have no proof other then these conversations but am I right to feel concerned and what is the best practise? I am not using the same company as my colleague so cant imagine it is being done with my pay.

                              <span>Some may be unaware of the big issue. Basically the Inquiry is investigating 2000 mental health deaths in across NHS trusts in Essex. The Inquiry has been given legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence (but only after pressure from relatives and the Chair of the Inquiry. 
 &quot;Dr Geraldine Strathdee [.....] had said she could not effectively do her job without those powers. She said only 30% of named staff – those essential witnesses involved in deaths she was investigating – had agreed to attend evidence sessions.&quot; Read all about it! https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/28/inquiry-mental-health-deaths-essex-nhs-trusts-given-legal-powers
 Check the Inquiry website for more details: https://lampardinquiry.org.uk/
 Nobody should be under any illusion that excess deaths among mental health patients isolated just to a patch in Essex. 
 I&#x27;ve been pissing in the wind and foaming at the mouth about the state of care in mental health services for the last 10 years. It is indeed deplorable that &#x27;people have to die&#x27; before anyone takes real notice. But.. but.. that&#x27;s how the Empire works. &#x27;You&#x27; could spot the same pattern of operation in several other spheres of UK life. 
 Well in the background I have factual inside information that lawyers are queuing up to sue (somebody). Who&#x27;s going down? Some from high command and some low hanging fruit. 
 Who&#x27;ll be going up? Where? Why that&#x27;ll be &#x27;some doctors&#x27; to the sacrificial altar of the GMC!! What - you don&#x27;t believe it? Just wait. 
 Horror stories in your patch of mental health services? Do share anonymously (no details that may identify an organisation or individual, or that are before a court or likely to be before a court). Not necessarily about deaths but what about abysmal care?

                              <span>I finished GP training at the end of January and went away travelling. Pay is staggered so I was expecting a February payment for January. I was expecting some sort of payment in March as my tax and remaining hours were added from February. Then I got a payment in March similar to my normal pay, I have again now received the same amount, this is a continuation on their behalf of my normal pay. Due to financial difficulties, I would struggle to repay these two payments. Can someone outline an email I can send to Payroll to rectify this matter, Ive read about agreeing a payment plan is this a well trodden path in this situation?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Keen on dual training in the future but I’m foxtrot oscaring to Australia at the end of F2 for a year or two. Can this time in ED count towards the “medical part” of my training? I’m lead to believe that I’m better off doing ACCS to avoid being an ST5 reg going back to be a gerries SHO. Just wondering if my ED experience in Aus will count and I can do Anaesthetic Core Training and then apply for an ICM number in ST5? 
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi team,
 I’ve already got plenty of tattoos but in pretty ‘safe for work’ areas - above elbows, torso etc.
 I’m into them, they make me happy and they’re cheaper than therapy post Covid ICU rotas. Outside work I’m in a hardcore music band and they’re very much part of the culture too. 
 I was thinking of getting some on my arms, and eventually even hands/neck when I find designs that are suitable. 
 Does anyone care anymore? I’ve got a training number, I kind of think ‘f*ck it’ at this point. I am aware though that this is not everyone’s opinion and there is a lot of unconscious bias around them, particularly job hunting if I’m planning to CCT and flee. 
 Ideas, concerns, expectations? Thx.

                              <span>Hello all,
 It&#x27;s your friendly neighbourhood IMG, who has never lived in London. I got offered a post in the South London Deanery, and I could use your expert opinions.
 The first thing that I am worried about is the cost of living. Will I be able to afford to live on my own in London with the salary of an ST3? Seeing that now I am almost 30 years old, I think I am ready to start making a step ahead in my life and try to get my own place. I dread the fact that I might be going into my early 30s and not being able to afford to live on my own. 
 The second thing that I would like to ask for your advice on is which areas of London would you advise me to seek a house in. My deanery is going to be in South London, but I have heard rumours that it can be quite dangerous. I have never lived in a dangerous city in the past and I would rather avoid areas with high criminal rates. Which areas would you recommend? Do you think it is a good idea to live above the river and commute every day?
 One final thing that I would like to mention is that currently I am not able to afford a car, as I have spent a fortune on my Royal College exams, courses, study material etc. Will I be able to reach the hospitals in my Deanery using public transport or is owning a car a must?
 Many thanks! xoxo

 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Was speaking to an old colleague back in the UK he says it is quite common now for trusts there to recruit consultants in all fields directly from overseas with minimal if any UK experience. How is this allowed? With such bottle necks in training there it makes it even more ludicrous for hospitals to take these shortcuts. For all the gripes with US training at least it&#x27;s on a level field once you are in residency you are guaranteed an attending job no ifs or buts and you won&#x27;t be gazumped by someone from overseas.

Of course you won’t be paid for this time, however they are your senior and you don’t want to ruin your relationship with them as you will be working with them for the next 4 months. 
 Please feel free to share your own personal experiences and how you dealt with them, as an incoming F1 with social anxiety and a hatred of confrontation this is something that really worries me about starting work

                              <span>Like the title says, I’m expecting to be involved in an SI. For obvious reasons I will be very vague about the details. 
 My biggest mistake was not documenting that I escalated it to the consultant, because consultants are notoriously bad at documenting their actions thereafter so I guess on paper it looks like I was the last contact with the patient. Before I knew the final patient outcome, I told the consultant about my anxiety around the situation and they said “it’s fine, you escalated it to me, it was my responsibility”, but obviously I didn’t write that on paper and they didn’t document anything after that. 
 Fully expecting to be contacted about this case and am beyond anxious about how it will play out. 
 I’m a foundation year. Will involvement in something like this affect my future career? 
 As soon as I felt out of my depth with the symptoms, that’s when I handed it over to the consultant. Technically the symptom was escalated to me, but I didn’t know what to do so I escalated further. We all know the first month of rotation is very much finding your feet, I had no idea what to do in this specific situation, hence the further escalation as I wasn’t getting anywhere. If something goes wrong, do consultants often field the responsibility and inquests themselves or do they often bounce the blame back at the more junior doctor? 
 I’m absolutely terrified and this physical and overwhelming anxiety is enough to make me seriously question a future in this career. I don’t ever want to be involved in this stuff but it seems like perfect storms happen and I fucking hate this

 Two weeks ago I was diagnosed with cancer and my child doesn’t yet know. I’m tired, stressed and am doing my best. That’s the context. Today I took my child to the UTC after being unable to seek advice about the best thing to do from the GP. My child had two unexplained falls (one witnessed) two days in a row e.g. didn’t trip, wasn’t pushed. I thought I needed to just check they were okay today after the second fall (lump on their head) so took them to the UTC. After being triaged and waiting for a few hours we saw a doctor (FY2). I was told that as there was no loss of consciousness or vomitin…</span>

                              <span>I just wonder if everyone who needs a booster is able to get one. In the last round I was eligible for one due to a family member&#x27;s medical condition, but the NHS have changed the rules meaning I no longer qualify, strangely. I found it desperately hard to find a pharmacy in Scotland who could do a private one - I just happened to be driving through near a place that did it. Otherwise I&#x27;d still be waiting. With the cost at £75 that is going to make it even harder for people to get one. I&#x27;m worried that people are going to be at risk due to location or financial situations.

 Is it possible that one of my phone settings is blocking no-ID calls? I just cannot figure out why this keeps happening.

SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate and evolve with important genetic and antigenic evolution of the spike protein.
The objective of an update to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition is to enhance vaccine-induced immune responses to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.
As the virus is expected to continue to evolve from JN.1, the TAG-CO-VAC advises the use of a monovalent JN.1 lineage as the antigen in future formulations of COVID-19 vaccines.
In accordance with WHO SAGE policy, vaccination programmes should continue to use any of the WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination should not be delayed in anticipation of access to vaccines with an updated composition.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an img due to CCT in less than a year, and it just keeps looking like I should either leave the UK and/or GP as a speciality.
 First off, GP is really grueling. Infact more gruelling than my previous job in ED. Most people seem to only be able to tolerate 6-7 sessions/wk. As a salaried that can be as low as 66-77k a year. As a clinical fellow in ED I was making 63k after banding. Like...what is the point in being a salaried GP? 
 Like I can genuinely make more than this, if I currently go back to work as a clinical fellow job in Wales,Scotland or NI. It would probably be easier too.
 Last week, my supervisor the other week said to me &quot;it&#x27;s true the job market is bad. It&#x27;s true that you are competing with ARRs roles&quot;. So I have to work super hard for 66-77k. Pathetic. Why not just retrain in literally any speciality in Wales?
 I don&#x27;t understand. I really like this country and want to work here. But why would anyone continue to work this hard in GP? Like It&#x27;s feel literally crazy for me to stay in this country. 
 Please tell me I&#x27;m missing something. I must be missing something.

                              <span>Adult nurses are so much more helpful - they won’t sigh, roll their eyes and behave like you’re asking them to move a mountain when you ask them to do a set of observations or a urine dipstick or to give a prescribed medicine to a patient. 
 Every single paediatric nurse I’ve come across in my time as a doctor (except for a handful I could count on one hand) have been nothing but entitled, rude and quite frankly unwilling to do anything asked of them unless they want to do it. Also find it bizarre most claim not to be trained in taking bloods from children and expect an F1 or any other doctor who doesn’t come across children nearly as much as them to do the bloods instead. Paediatric trainee doctors constantly have to do their own urine dipsticks and observations - can their HCA/nurses not do this? Adult nurses are also busy but they don’t go around saying “im busy I’ll try if I can get round to it” when you ask them to do the most basic thing. Also paediatric nurses when they speak to speciality teams honestly just come across as rude and entitled and quick to behave passive aggressively or straight up rude. I find the temperament of (most) adult nurses to be a lot more mature, level headed and less likely to behave like a bratty teenage girl. 
 Could someone shed light on this?

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 I’m in the dark about the lowest rank offers in psych at the moment. Are people actually receiving offers from the recent recycles, or is it just radio silence for everyone? If anyone has any information or updates on this, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

                              <span>Hello all
 Managed to get an offer for LAT in gastro in Northern Scotland. Ranked bottom order end. 
 Im inclined to accept this as want to get into a structured program rather than spend time as trust grade or locum. I am split but generally glad tbh. 
 Questions 
 1- what are the experiences of people who have done LAT? How does this affect applications next year? Does it help? 2- Any idea where Ill be spending the year? I would hope it would be ARI rather than iverness or shetland as that would be less than ideal. 3- What is the expected salary take home for st4 as i understand the taxes are different compared to England? 4- Any comments about training and training opportunities up north? 5- Any comments about living costs and accommodation 
 Thanks in advance 
 Kind regards

                              <span>I feel like a lot of oncology patients who are admitted with acute medical problems haven&#x27;t had resuscitation discussed with them by their oncologist, or haven&#x27;t got a DNAR in place in situations when they really should have one, so I end up discussing with them and completing the paperwork. Do you as oncologists reverse these decisions when you see patients after they&#x27;re discharged?

                              <span>I went through medical school always wanting to be an orthopaedic surgeon. I graduated and completed FY1 and FY2. I then got into core surgical training on the second attempt - this was a huge feat for me and I worked damn hard to get in. I thought I’d made it. I thought I was finally going to be a surgeon. My CST years were some of the most gruelling of my life - i sacrificed so much to progress and prepare a portfolio for St3 applications. The MRCS exams took a huge mental toll on me. I sat Part A 3 times and passed Part B the first time. Regarding MRCS, I wasn’t alone. I know a lot of my colleagues who also had multiple attempts. Since finishing core surgical training, I have applied to ST3 Trauma and Orthopaedic surgery 3 times. I have been unsuccessful each time. I thought this year was different. I had prepared very well only to be thrown under the bus in the interview. The clinical scenarios were much harder than previous years and I feel like the whole interview process was just poorly delivered. I am also disappointing my family and friends by not getting a training number so the mental toll is a lot. I am planning to give it 1 more shot next year. I guess I just came to Reddit for some motivation during a time where I feel as though all hope is lost.

 How do you approach this as an SHO? 
 Surely, if they were extremely concerned they can send the patient to A&amp;E where they would then be referred to the specialist if needed. Or, they should see the patient themselves and then refer appropriately.

                              <span>For example ent has a month of Locum’s coming up, nights only. Ent is also very strict about how long you’ve spent in the specialty post f2. 
 If an f3 locum did this month of nights would this count as time spent in a specialty. What does the hive mind think?

                              <span>IMT3 here, funnily enough IMT breeds burnout (who&#x27;d have thought it!). But everyone around me (literally every other IMT3 I work with) is hellbent on entering training ASAP as everyone says there won&#x27;t be any training numbers left soon. Everyone else is off to take ST4 numbers in August. I&#x27;ve taken a more chilled approach this year as it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite the mega competition of core training (yet....) and my mental health is sort of in the toilet.
 I&#x27;d love 1-2 years out to decompress, see the world, see family, be a normal non doctor human. I&#x27;m pre kids so I could have a lot of freedom and nice times. Or I could aim for ST4 next round starting training in Feb 2025 (if I&#x27;m lucky, there should be numbers in areas of country I&#x27;d like to live in).....
 Is being a consultant lots better? Should I be pushing towards consultancy soon and ending the misery of med reg night shifts and rotating? Or will I be a 35 year old consultant with a couple of kids regretting prioritising my career over a couple of fufilling years out of training?
 I&#x27;m female and expect to take a few mat leaves and then LTFT so I suspect I won&#x27;t get there very fast regardless, it&#x27;s whether or not I add 1-2 years extra on by taking some time to chill now vs cracking on with HST for a couple years at 100%. We see young people die at work which I think skews my view that life is short and work doesn&#x27;t matter all that much.
 I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone who entered ST4 after a couple of years out, do you regret it now when you see people who were at your stage and are now consultants whilst you&#x27;re still working nights? Or do you feel lucky that you had amazing experiences that you just can&#x27;t have in your 40s/50s when tied down by kids and a mortgage?
 P.S. I really like my family/friends in the UK, so despite the absolutely appalling weather I don&#x27;t want to CCT and flee so this would be based on life staying in the UK for the long term

                              <span>I have a suspicion that I didn&#x27;t get paid for the bank holiday on Easter Monday (01/04) although I was rostered to work that day. Now that I have my payslip, how do I find out if I was paid for that day? If I add up the worked/earned column should it equate to how many hours worked in the month, and when does the pay month begin/end? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have completed core psychiatry training and have opted to take some time out of training for personal reasons and am looking to move to a speciality doctor role (potentially long term and looking for some protections e.g. sick pay, parental leave, etc., hence why I am less keen on locuming). 
 I&#x27;m struggling to find a huge amount of information about what nodal point I would come in at on the SAS payscale. Is it nodal point 4 because I have three years of psychiatry experience or is it nodal point 8 because I have over seven years of NHS service? I have also read that people have had some success in negotiating there starting point with their trust.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ll start off with fonts and styles. This may be of importance to those doctors whose work is text-intensive and where quality of presentation matters e.g. senior doctors in psychiatry and expert witness doctors. 
 In psychiatry the work is text intensive for producing reports of various kinds: Tribunal reports, Managers&#x27; reports, CPA, CTR, Court of Protection and so on. Presentancy is &#x27;everything&#x27; (chuhknowwhuhahmean). Most &#x27;medics&#x27; - or is that doctors - don&#x27;t give a monkeys about fonts or Styles. Some don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s that Style ribbon at the top of MS Word is for, nor do their typists (secretaries or admins). I&#x27;m not doing a tutorial on that here. 
 What is of relevance is that for the doctors who need to format there work for &#x27;presentancy&#x27; and readability (like me) are being told that Trusts require all correspondence to be in Arial 12pt, by policy. No such policy has been found over the last 10 years of me searching for it across 10 Trusts. I dare say it does not exist.
 But wait - I started off with one issue to illustrate something else that happens in your beloved NHS What&#x27;s that?
 Loads of people make up policies as they go along. The commonest is &#x27;good practice&#x27;. Nobody quoting anything of &#x27;good practice&#x27; has been able to provide me with a reference to the &#x27;good practice&#x27;. 
 The other one was &quot;No patient gets Sectioned unless they have a CTR (care and treatment review).&quot; No such policy exists in writing anywhere and if it exists it is legally wrong. 
 And another, &quot;Intensive support must be consulted before a LD patient is sectioned&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t exist. Can&#x27;t find that anywhere (though it may well exist in a neck of the woods somewhere that I&#x27;ve not been). 
 I&#x27;d like to hear from those who have witnessed the same sort of making up of policies.

                              <span>Trying to avoid ranting. Here&#x27;s my experience. 
  
was on waitlist for fy1. Found out shortly before starting where I was working. Jumped in to hospital accomodation. Had a detrimental effect on personal life being short notice. Didn&#x27;t have time to sort a flat. 
 in a pretty depressing part of the country. 
 got bullied during one rotation by senior doc. Was very stressed and put my head down. Didn&#x27;t get signed off. Some concerns. Overall 90% of feedback is good. Still unsure what will happen come ARCP 
 during above period, a romantic relationship fell apart. 
 I was very burned out but managed to get some sick leave with strikes which gave me a couple weeks off. 
 I have enough left in the tank to finish just about. 
 I have to move from current location. 
 I have connections in a good ed (which i like) in a nice city, apparently there is locum work there. Buts it&#x27;s expensive. 
 I also have connections abroad down under. Could get a job there. 
  
-right now I&#x27;m unsure of next steps. It&#x27;s pretty daunting thinking about moving. I&#x27;m just exhausted and dont trust myself.
 I just need a break now. Any kind words or words of wisdom appreciated. I&#x27;m better but still stressed. I have spoken with PH and gained some support. In counselling. any kind words appreciated.

                              <span>Quick question that has me a bit baffled…
 I was in an elective c-section, after birth baby had poor tone and no initial respiratory effort. Anyways after resuscitation by the midwife, the buzzer was pulled as baby’s sats were still low despite inflation breaths, NG aspiration of stomach and subsequent face mask O2.
 In response to the buzzer and “paeds” being called, an ACP from paeds attended. She was great, and I learnt stuff from her when I was asking questions about management, and it seemed that everything right was done for baby.
 But an ACP? To essentially a crash call? For adults senior doctors attend. So what is going on here? The ACP seemed quite well versed in everything, but this doesn’t sit right with me. 
 There was a point where the ACP said “if things don’t improve by x time, I’m calling my reg”, but why wasn’t a paediatrician there initially? NICU is on the same floor!!! 
 I know that even paeds isn’t safe from scope creep and noctors, but can’t we get real doctors to attend to a neonatal emergency.
 Maybe this was because it hadn’t quite gotten to cardiac arrest? But initially wasn’t far off.

                              <span>Hi, I was just wondering whether people have been successful with interdeanery transfers after having a baby born. Current deanery is over 1.5 hours away from parental home, and unfortunately daycare hours are not enough as they do not cover weekends or hours after 6pm. Also, having grandparents pick up child from daycare if need be, any advice would help appreciated

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve found a ridiculously good deal for a holiday in Jan 2025 for a 2 week package - is it worth the risk to book this and then negotiate AL/swapping shifts? I&#x27;m completely naive to the rota and AL as a doctor as I&#x27;m still a final year medical student hopefully starting FY1 in August 2024. Please can you enlighten me? My 2nd rotation is a medical job in a tertiary centre in a rather niche specialty (I think it&#x27;s niche anyways - endocrinology) if that adds any weighting to your advice. I also want to say thank you in advance to everyone who replies, I&#x27;ve posted quite a few times asking all my silly questions and have always received amazing advice and replies so tysm to you all!!

                              <span>Hi guys, having looked at the IMT scoring matrix I just wanted to check as it doesn’t explicitly state on the website, can you use surgical/other specialty achievements such as audit/publication etc as part of the scoring for the IMT long listing assessment points? Aware that for interview purposes obviously better to have medical stuff but just in terms of pure points is this allowed? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m on a community placement and we often get medical students coming through. Last week we had a student join us during the morning MDT meeting and introduced herself as a medical student. We did a few cases together during the week and she seemed uninterested in anything I had to teach but was very keen to jump in and take over the patient interviews. I didn&#x27;t mind her confidence but she took irrelevant histories and didn&#x27;t seem to understand a lot of basics. She always tried to go out of her way to agree with the consultant and it felt like she was trying to &quot;one up&quot; me. It really didn&#x27;t seem like normal behaviour for a medical student so figured she was just a very driven student who had yet to start her downward journey on the dunning-kruger graph.
 I found out from one of the nurses that she was a nursing student, and was told many of them introduce themselves as medical students, which we agreed was disingenuous. She later confirmed that she would be finishing nursing school soon when asked in front of our MDT.
 I&#x27;m not originally from the UK, but is it normal for nursing students to identify themselves as medical students? I was introducing her as a medical student, and now I&#x27;m feeling guilty about misleading my patients.

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m starting GPST1 in August in Derby.
 I&#x27;ve ranked all my allocations but can&#x27;t seem to figure out which ones are HEFT or not. I&#x27;ve contacted the Admin team which aren&#x27;t very helpful. 
 Can someone tell me where exactly it specifies that rotations are HEFT? It doesn&#x27;t say anything on the preference list for me, or when I click each rotation for further information. 
 Would appreciate any help, thank you.

                              <span>It&#x27;s seems every patient is complaining about the NHS, especially GPs. A few months ago I drafted a response to a bizarre patient complaint... the patient had booked an appointment under her name so her dog could get some antibiotics for a cough/chest infection. I&#x27;m not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation. Then she complained to the practice and when rebuffed, went to the NHS obusdman who shut her down too. What is wrong with people!?!?!?
 So guys, what&#x27;s the funniest or bizarre complaints you&#x27;ve been part of?

 I&#x27;ve been asked to step up as a stroke SpR to cover gaps. I&#x27;ll have to do ward liaison and TIA clinics and hold the bleep.
 I want to ask for some advice and perspective on what will be expected of me and where I can brush up my knowledge. 
 Thank you for your input

                              <span>I have applied and been accepted for this diet of PACES by the RCP Edinburgh.
 When applying they asked where I have worked, to which I answered the city hospital I have spent the last 3 years. 
 They have put me in the DGH ~30miles away. I am due to continue working in my current hospital and am not due to go this DGH, or any other nearby, at all during core training. However, it does fall under my deanery.
 I had thought you couldnt have PACES in your home deanery, but am now realising I can&#x27;t find anything online to that effect.
 Have I lucked out, or has the royal college made an error?

                              <span>have been reading about the placeholder issue, and spoken to someone affected. its an absolutely awful situation and given that UK medical graduates require F1 to have full registration, it shouldn&#x27;t be that people are left without that year.
 European medical schools have the last year as part of your medical school - well you do work but unless apply to leave and work elsewhere you work locally in a hospital.
 please can someone who knows the historic background explain why this was changed in UK?
 and wouldn&#x27;t it be better if everyone had the first option to stay locally (guaranteed in their deanery) with those who have good reasons to leave apply to leave? rather than this lottery mess?
 and if we thought this was better, how can we as seniors petition for this / support this to happen?

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 I was hoping to get some advice about what I could be doing during my gap year before f1.
 ​
 I’ve been allocated this year to a region that is well away from my support network and would not be good for my mental wellbeing to start working this year whilst feeling isolated.
 ​
 Although there is no guarantee this won’t happen again next year, I am considering taking a year out.
 ​
 Has anyone taken a gap year before F1? Any suggestions on what would be useful to do for speciality applications moving forward?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I was an international student that graduated from a UK medical school in 2020 and completed FY1. Due to issues at home I had to leave the UK and foundation programme post FY1 to be at home and have been working in my home country as an SHO grade doctor since in Internal Medicine (staying until the end of FY2 was not really a viable option at the time). 
 When I had left post FY1, my foundation school was under the impression that if I were to consider coming back, this would be via a standalone F2 post or CREST form - which I have been made aware in the last few years that CREST is only open to doctors who have never been in the foundation program. 
 Was wondering if anyone has advice on available routes back to the UK, as well as if I were to attempt to return - if it would have to be back at F2 level or if I would be able to apply for training later on should I plan to complete further qualifications eg MRCP exams. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 So, I work on an elderly care discharge ward, where people are supposed to be MOFD. But spending months waiting for social issues to sort out, they keep getting new medical issues.
 Plus, there are chronic medical issues that families want taken care of, while they are in the hospital, as an opportunistic bonus.
 Now, its basically just me and a PA (nice but relatively new). Before, it was me and another SHO and we used to divide patients evenly.
 We&#x27;re being told to prioritize TTOs rather than clinical reviews because pharmacy can&#x27;t process orders (dosette boxes) in time if we do them after noon
 The issue at hand is that i usually need time to look at a patient my own way, and write in my own style. I&#x27;m a bit conscious of making sure that I&#x27;m not missing any key details when reviewing a patient, or that any TTO I write is well written.
 Also, the ward manager is insisting that instead of breaking up patients, we divide tasks instead. Things like &quot;Oh, the PA can write the discharge summary and you can prescribe.....&quot;
 The PA is a nice lady and she can take bloods decent enough...(somewhat)
 The problem is, I can&#x27;t review patients late (all the investigation results and imaging gets delayed), and I seriously hate prescribing meds (Especially CDs) when the written portion is a missing key details (like why a drug was discontinued or whether a resus status was changed)
 I take pride in my work, and want to do it in its entirety.
 Does anyone how to handle this kinda workload?
 It&#x27;s gotten so bad that normally, an MOFD patient is supposed to be reviewed every week just to see if they&#x27;re ok, and no one&#x27;s reviewing them for 2-3 weeks.

Reason I ask is because my employer said that May is my last pay check. CCT day (June 1 st) and workplace has me on their schedule as working a normal day.

                              <span>I was invited for a cervical screening a couple months ago by my GP practice and had the test a little over a month ago. They told me the result was going to be communicated to me by post in up to 4 weeks. I already have had an altered result for a smear test before (they knew it) so I was worried. A couple days ago I received a text message from NHS England booking me an appointment for a colposcopy. 
 Now, I’m also a healthcare professional and know what a colposcopy is and the reason why they had booked me one (the test showed abnormal cells) but this was never actually communicated to me by any means. I called my surgery, they said the doctor would call me back that day. They never did. I replied to the text message to rebook the appointment since I’m gonna be in my period on the date …</span>

The dressing needs to be changed tomorrow. Yes it&#x27;s my fault for not updating the GP of my move, I didn&#x27;t realize this would be an issue. I&#x27;m looking for advice. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s infected but I can&#x27;t remove the non dosovable stitches myself, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s infected, GP says they can&#x27;t visit me anymore as I&#x27;m not in the catchment area and I can&#x27;t physically make it to the private hospital as it&#x27;s too far away and I&#x27;m in too much pain.

                              <span>My question is I was employed by the NHS from Jan 23 as I understand you get 1only get 1 month sick leave in your first year. It&#x27;s now nearly may 24 my question is am I still considered in my first year of service or my second year of service? I was told that I had to complete my second year of service before I&#x27;m entitled to two months sick pay, which doesn&#x27;t make sense as I&#x27;d technically be in my third year of service?
 Do I need to complete the entire year of service before I&#x27;m entitled to second year service sick leave or am I entitled to that now as I&#x27;ve technically worked here more than 12 consecutive months.

 Community midwives and health visitors are completely useless. 
 Can I stop visiting our community midwife without any legal implications?

                              <span>I’m feeling desperately unwell &amp; NHS practise here says problem with blood test but refusing to give me results - say I need to speak to doctor but doctor “unavailable” - next appointment is in 3 weeks. That’s enough time to do permanent nerve damage if something like B12 deficiency or other deficiencies. 
 Previous practise in countryside never posed problems like this- they emailed results promptly &amp; booked doctor appointment at later date, but allowed you to see result before appointment. 
 This is my data- it should be law they they cannot refuse. Had this nonsense before in other practises as well. Unbelievable!

                              <span>I left A&amp;E yesterday due to the wait times which I know is because hospital staff are stretched thin. I wasn’t formally admitted I don’t think by which I mean I didn’t see a doctor, get a bed or like a wristband. I spoke to a nurse on the floor of the waiting room I was in about not wanting to stay any longer than I already had, who told me I could sign some self-discharge papers, which I did. Today my final discharge papers from there have come in where it says “patient walked out” under diagnosis. That sounds like I just up and walked out without saying anything to anyone but I’m no healthcare professional so I’m not sure if that’s okay. I wanted to ask if anyone knows if that’s all okay and adds up, and if it’s likely to cause any issues now or in the future? Thanks!!
 I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this so if not I’m sorry

                              <span>I am currently signed off sick from work (clinical patient facing) due to mental health following a difficult shift. I am looking to move into a different sector outside of clinical patient facing work but would need an interview. I do not feel able to return to my current role but do not want to leave with no job to go to. How can I legally attend an interview? I don’t see how I can ask for annual leave during a period of sickness especially if I am not fit to work.

                              <span>I got my first choice GPST rotation:
 6 months GP.
 3 months hospital rotations x2.
 6 months ITP - 2 days GP and 3 psych.
 3 months hospital x2.
 12 months GP.
 They&#x27;re saying that if I do it 80% LTFT I won&#x27;t meet the 12 months in hospital requirement because ITP doesn&#x27;t count?! Despite it being over half the week in psych (they said I&#x27;ll only get 1 day of GP if I&#x27;m part time).
 So I&#x27;ll have to do an extra 3 month hospital rotation or convert ITP into 4 days psychiatry instead of 3 + 1 GP.
 Does this sound right to anyone?

                              <span>GP here. l will be taking up a salaried post and was told by the practice manager that I will be included in the practice indemnity. 
 Admin from primary care services is asking for evidence of my professional indemnity. Should I get the practice to write something as evidence that I would be included in practice indemnity or I should get MDDUS to give me a quote for a nominal coverage? 
 Been a salaried with a Scottish health board since CCT so has been covered under CNORIS with a nominal 0 session coverage with MDDUS in order to join the performers list. Going to move health board now so a bit confused.

 Is there a plan or schedule of topics that will be covered over the year?
 Are you asked for feedback and is that feedback named or anonymous?
 What would you suggest to improve it?

                              <span>It&#x27;s seems every patient is complaining about the NHS, especially GPs. A few months ago I drafted a response to a bizarre patient complaint... the patient had booked an appointment under her name so her dog could get some antibiotics for a cough/chest infection. I&#x27;m not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation. Then she complained to the practice and when rebuffed, went to the NHS obusdman who shut her down too. What is wrong with people!?!?!?
 So guys, what&#x27;s the funniest or bizarre complaints you&#x27;ve been part of?

 I&#x27;ve had two complaints so far and I&#x27;m feeling a little deflated. My trainer has said the patients were being unreasonable both times, and apart from being &quot;more polite&quot; there wasn&#x27;t any learning to take away. She didn&#x27;t even recommend writing a reflection on them, which I may do anyway but I&#x27;m not sure how to word it? Or what learning I should be taking away?
 The first one: I asked the patient to book another appointment to discuss problem #3 as I had others waiting and had started to run behind. The issue wasn&#x27;t urgent - I quickly checked red flags and then booked him in for 2 days later. He called later that day, angry that he had to come back in. I thought I&#x27;d been pretty polite about it, explained that I needed to take a full history and do another examina…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to work out whether I need to be asking my F1 and F2 trusts for a pension rebate because I worked additional hours as a locum from which pension was taken off. 
 Struggling to find information on whether pay above full time hours / locum pay while being on a substantive contract is pensionable. 
 BMA seems to suggest all pay should be included &quot; Accrual in the 2015 scheme is based on each year’s actual earnings and service and whole time pay is not relevant. From 1 October 2022 Officer pension contribution tiers in England and Wales are linked to actual pensionable pay and not the notional full time equivalent rate.&quot;
 NHSBA seems to suggest differently &quot;Overtime, in relation to the NHS Pension Scheme, is hours worked in excess of the whole time standard working week. Therefore a part timer’s pensionable pay must include any additional hours worked up to the whole time working week, and hours worked over the whole time working week are not pensionable. For example, if the standard working week is 37.5 hours, a part timer normally working 20 hours a week may pay pension contributions on up to 17.5 additional hours per week.&quot;
 But then also this from NHSBA? &quot;The payroll solution must use the previous scheme years actual pensionable earnings to set the member contribution rate (instead of using whole-time equivalent earnings). If the member did not work a full year the actual earnings should be annualised.&quot;
 ​
 What&#x27;s right? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m just not reading it all correctly tbh.
 Is the best thing to do just to ask payroll?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m an incoming F1. I&#x27;ve managed to get really lucky getting my first choice rotation in my (granted not-competitive) first choice deanery. All exams have been passed and its just placements standing between me and working as a doctor. 
 While I am excited, I&#x27;m starting to get really nervous. I&#x27;ll be at a hospital I&#x27;ve never been at before, I don&#x27;t know anyone else who will be working at that hospital. I know this is the same for most people, but I am really worried I won&#x27;t find anyone to go through the tough stuff with - I feel like it&#x27;s taken me all the years of medical school to finally find a group of people I&#x27;m at least semi-comfortable with. I feel like I&#x27;m just chronically misunderstood by peers and I am just worried about how everything will all go. 
 I&#x27;ve already spoken to OH, they have mentioned something about a WRAP form but other than that I don&#x27;t even know what can be done to help someone who&#x27;s autistic in a ward setting. 
 I guess I&#x27;m just starting to panic a bit. I suppose I&#x27;m looking for reassurance that foundation is doable, and maybe some tips if anyone has any. 
 Thank you 🙏

                              <span>I was lucky enough to get a post for core anaesthetics training and will be starting in August. 
 I want to try and do a bit of background reading before I start to hopefully make it a bit easier during the novice period. 
 I appreciate many people will say this isn’t needed but I have a decent amount of free time during the day to use up as I’m currently on a GP rotation that’s pretty chill and can still enjoy my weekends / evenings etc
 A few people have mentioned the e-learning for healthcare course. I was wondering if anyone could point me to any other good resources

                              <span>Hello 👋 
 I am looking for some advice from anyone who has left medicine for another career. 
 Whilst I enjoy clinical medicine - I have recently begun to question its sustainability as a longer term career.
 I’d like to use my transferable skills, but ultimately work in a non-clinical role (if healthcare adjacent) or a completely unrelated field.
 If anyone has practical advice or real life experience - I would be grateful to hear from you. 
 Thank you ☺️

                              <span>F2 here going to F3 and did not apply for training this time due to personal reasons. But will apply for 2025 start. I can’t imagine myself in any specialty other than histopath and I am quite set on it but the insane competition ratio is quite disheartening and I feel even with a QIP in pathology, a first author publication (non histopath but is related to another medical specialty) and some teaching experience (delivered occasional teaching here and there but planning on histopath specific ones aimed at FYs) and tasters, I won’t even make it to the interview. So to maximise the points, I was looking at events hosted by RcPath but they seem to be aimed at consultant level doctors rather than suitable for absolute novices like myself. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Do haematology events count (from what I know this is a group 2 medical specialty rather than a pathology specialty so was unsure whether there was any point)?
 Any tips?

                              <span>Looking for advice on getting an SAS / specialty doctor post in sexual health / GUM.
 I&#x27;m a GP by background (CCTed a few years ago), and have worked in a non clinical public health related job for the past year. I&#x27;ve got an interest in sexual health with a couple of previous GUM jobs during training and have done the DFSRH. A little out of date with it all now, but really enjoyed previous work in this area. 
 I&#x27;d really appreciate advice from anyone who works as a specialty (non-training grade) doctor in sexual health. Particularly interested in how you ended up in this role, what level of experience is needed, and how I can improve my chances of getting a post. 
 If anyone is willing to have a chat or offer some advice on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!

We’re stuck with one clunky Excel sheet on a pesky L drive that won’t let more than one user open and edit the list. This isn’t unique to this job; all of my patient lists in my previous jobs have been on Word or Excel documents on an L drive. 
 Surely there’s a slicker, GDPR-compliant, NHS Trust-friendly of going about this? What do you guys use?

                              <span>Hi all
 Got a Neurosurgery JCF job interview coming up. I&#x27;m quite excited about it since I&#x27;ve enjoyed previous surgically-minded jobs, and have been reading up common emergencies that I might deal with eg post op hyponatremia.
 Problem is when I try to look at troubleshooting ventricular drains, most guidelines essentially say &quot;call neurosurgery&quot; or to replace the drain.
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone might share their insights into a JCF&#x27;s approach to common issues. What might I be phoned about from the wards, and what would they expect me to try in the first instance before escalating to SpR?
 Thank you for your time.

                              <span>I was doing a clinic today with my consultant &amp; there was an assistant with us helping and coordinating the patients. One of the patients was grateful and very emotional and brought us biscuits as a gesture. When the patient left the clinic, the assistant immediately picked the 3£ gift and went: “Are we even allowed to accept that? I’ll put it in the staff room and you can help yourselves if you want you”
 I mean FFS !!!! Our assistants are so brainwashed from the ridiculously demeaning position of NHS doctors that they would not even have the courtesy to ask permission from the consultant, who the gift is presumably for and who is also in charge of their own clinic, before taking the gift away.
 I did a good job for my patient, my patient expressed their gratefulness by gifting a 3£ biscuit, I felt rewarded that they are grateful- but no, the NHS culture would make sure to remind us that we do not even deserve this gesture.
 I am so fed up with the recurrent manifestations of this upside down hierarchy at the NHS where everyone think, act and actually are the bosses except doctors. I think this culture towards doctors at the NHS is so bad that I doubt reversing it would happen in my lifetime and I would rather run away than spending my career devalued.
 Rant over

                              <span>Hey everyone, I’m a final year due to start in Aug. Currently doing ward jobs atm with a fair bit of free rein (under supervision of course). I normally do really well with osces etc however I feel like doing the daily reviews etc, I’m struggling to come up with my own plans and just forgetting stupid stuff- such as day 2 post-op with (in hindsight) very obvious pneumonia/Lrti presentation. In an examination it just comes naturally to say things like XR etc but on the wards I just feel like I’m forgetting really stupid stuff and the management plans I know I can do just aren’t translating in to practice?
 Wondering if anyone has any advice thank u!

                              <span>I&#x27;m peripherally involved in simulation training at my local medical school. The simulator is pretty simple: a mannequin, a monitor, some dummy drugs to be drawn up or checked, some blood gas print outs and people pretending to be nurses, registrars etc. The trainees are final year medical students, FY1s and FY2s. The simulated scenarios are vanilla adult medical and surgical emergencies in which the trainee is called to the ward for a patient that&#x27;s &quot;gone off&quot;.
 The scenarios themselves seem pretty realistic and I try to make the debriefings as educational as possible using the After Action Review model, but it seems the trainees get no particular preparation on emergencies before the simulation day and there&#x27;s no follow up afterwards on lessons identified. It&#x27;s just one or two simulator days a year in isolation. I&#x27;ve discussed this with the faculty who run the simulator but their view is that preparation and follow up are Someone Else&#x27;s Problem.
 Has anyone had better experience of sim training than this?

                              <span>Hey guys-I&#x27;m back with another MRCP part 2 exam question. I think cardiology is really screwing me over....I&#x27;d appreciate any advice. Thank you in advance. 
 A 45 year old is admitted with palpitations following excess alcohol consumption at a wedding. His BP is 90/50 and his HR is 130 bpm and regular. 
 Bloods were all normal. 
 ECG:

 What is the most appropriate intervention?
 Amiodarone
 Digoxin
 DC Cardioversion
 Metoprolol 
 Verapamil 
 ​
 I thought that since he&#x27;s haemodynamically unstable we would go for DC cardioversion however the answer is amiodarone. They stated that since the patient has a junctional tachycardia the treatment of choice is either IV amiodarone or IV flecainide. 
 I had a read about junctional tachycardia vs SVT. 
 So junctional tachycardia is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR &gt;100. SVT is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR &gt;150. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good paper to explain the management of junctional tachycardias because it sounds a bit different compared with SVT but I can&#x27;t find anything. One paediatric paper said that we can give amiodarone, another said phenytoin. And wikipedia has actually been the most helpful and said that we don&#x27;t normally do DC cardioversion in junctional tachycardia. 
 Is anyone able to shed some light on the management of junctional tachycardia and how it differs to SVT?

 Is it still worth doing these medical education masters courses?

 Mysteriously vanishes after the ward round and makes themselves uncontactable in the hope that the other resident doctors will give up trying to get hold of them and do their job for them.
 What is the best way to tackle these colleagues as an SHO?

                              <span>I completed a QI project with a colleague last year. I came up with the idea and did most of the work (probably a 70:30 split between us). We presented this and my name came first on the presentation. 
 I would like to submit our work to a conference as a poster. I don&#x27;t need my colleague&#x27;s help for creating the abstract or the poster itself. Does their name still need to go on the poster as they were involved in the work that happened prior? My suspicion is probably it does but I thought I would just check! Thanks.

 Does anyone know why we don&#x27;t just say 1mg/ml or 0.1mg/ml? 
 It just seems odd that we do it that way for such an important drug and often you get passed the wrong thing at arrests and such. And you end up back calculating in your brain for infusions. 
 I don&#x27;t ask for &#x27;1 in 100&#x27; propofol&#x27; or &#x27;1 in 200&#x27; bupivacaine. 
 Is there some historical reason?
 Why stop there with the slightly confusing descriptions? Why not ask for one 60th of a grain of adrenaline from the apothecary? Is it just me who finds this more confusing than it should be?
 So many questions.

                              <span>Hi all,
 The joys of rotational training and service provision have meant I will be placed in a hospital 70 miles away (1:40hr travel each way).
 My TPD is not very reasonable and quite mean as I had found someone to swap with but she would not let us swap. 
 I am thinking to ask for 80% LTFT to reduce the travel burden but am worried this will get rejected as other than making my life easier and being closer to family for longer I don’t have a super concrete reason.
 Is it worth asking or should I just suck it up for 6 months?

                              <span>Saw this posted on X, and seen its generated some debate for two reasons 
 1) ANP led consult (as expected always generates a convo) 2) variation in differentials from doctors and others alike
 So what do we all think ?
 Looks like contact dermatitis/ hidrandentitis suppartiva to me but could be wrong.
 (Seen someone comment its shingles which made me giggle)

                              <span>Question - are you allowed to do a taster in the same specialty twice?
 I did an anaesthetics taster this time last year at the end of FY1. Enjoyed it a lot and applied but didn’t get in due to MSRA. Hadn’t done any anaesthetics placements before that. Now have done an FY2 ED job and loved that too, so between the two.
 Worried about basing an entire career on a four day taster and not sure how I feel about it now which is why I wouldn’t mind doing it again but unsure if it’ll be approved.

                              <span>Lefty here. I have started training as ST1 in o&amp;g and I’m finding it so awkward to start operating, doing knots, etc. 
 I have started to use my right hand for most things because it feels more instinctive- but I suppose the handedness of the instruments (as all have been designed for right handed users) forced me to start using my right hand.
 Using my right hand feels awkward. Using my left hand feels awkward and painful (physically hurts to open the needle holder…. And lost instruments, with the L hand)
 How did lefties manage? Are there any resources? I haven’t found much online or on YouTube. Anything will be appreciated (:

 So I have had multiple depressive episodes throughout my life but the current one is the most severe so far. After remaining off work for 2 months, I returned to work a month ago. But things started to go downhill again and I have been signed off again for a short period of time.
 Apart from being fed up with the illness and life in general (maybe it&#x27;s worse due to the nature of the illness), I am also worried about being unemployed. What if I don&#x27;t feel better for a long time? Will I lose my training number? What about GMC? Also what about sickness triggers? Will I be subjected to HR reviews and what nots? I do enjoy my work and my speciality but I am completely burnt out from attempting exams and building portfolio and cannot see a future for myself when I am off sick for this long. 
 I have had 4 years of NHS service and should be eligible for 5 months of full pay. Despite explaining all these, payroll has deducted my salary and paid me peanuts. I understand that I have to chase it up and involve BMA but I have no fight left in me to deal with this.
 I did speak to my ES about all these who listened to my concerns but did nit offer much advice. I have had private counselling in the past but I cannot afford this anymore. I am completely overwhelmed and I would really appreciate if any one has any suggestions or just some kind words.

                              <span>After speaking to a couple of colleagues, it seems to be a consensus that it feels like service provision only.
 Teaching is a tick the box thing and most of the time uses archaic methods. There is no official allocated person and it relies on good will. They just throw a lot of information at you to cover the curriculum.
 The workplaces highly rely on you. Therefore, there is almost no time to thing through.
 Everything feels a tick exercise: presentations, supervisor meetings , portfolio.
 Plus: they bribe you with a teaching feedback if you teach medical students who pay expense yearly fees and were supposed to have allocated preceptors and etc.
 Does anyone have different views?
 Any hope things might change ?

                              <span>What are some of the weirdest conducts of colleagues that went unnoticed? 3 years in the NHS and I&#x27;ve seen some weird stuff. But some conduct cases always baffle me. Worked with an F1 who was least interested. Was alcoholic. Came late to work almost every day. Was a threat to patient care. Never really got caught in any tribunal or conduct cases somehow. Was made to re do the F1. Still has remained the same. But somehow finished F1 and now going to complete F2. Another doctor who shouted at another doctor on one incident was removed from training and referred to GMC (not saying it was right). Just weird how some blatant cases go without any major consequence, while others which we feel isn&#x27;t extreme is taken to GMC.

                              <span>Hi, wondering if anyone has any experience of this - is a current FY3 (so OOP) eligible for removal expenses if they are going into a training programme (GP if it matters). The guidelines aren&#x27;t quite clear, they say &quot;Trainees who are deemed to be out of programme (OOP) will not be eligible to claim relocation, temporary accommodation or excess mileage payments whilst they are out of programme but may claim expenses in order to support them returning to their training programme.&quot; Obviously am out of programme now, but won&#x27;t be once the training programme has started and so at the time I&#x27;d be claiming?

                              <span>The last installment of the Cass Review into care for gender questioning and transgender young people has been published this week, as I&#x27;m sure people have seen in the news. The big changes are the stopping of prescribing puberty blockers except through a clinical trial and a general shift in attitude away from an affirmative and medical pathway for gender transition towards exploratory psychological counselling. It&#x27;s been praised by both political parties, but criticised by trans groups and international organisations.
 Apart from the merits of these changes, does anyone know why this took the form of an independent service review rather than a national guideline by NICE/ RCPCH/ RCPsych or if there are plans to produce one in the future. As far as I can work out the old GIDS service was working off the The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines which have now been declared unacceptable by Dr Cass. Has there ever been a UK guideline produced in this area?

Salaries can only keep falling so much before people accept private salaries (even assuming private salaries will be lower, as claimed by some people). 
 
Post-CCT salaries also look like shit
 
 We need to go private and take the trainees with us. Design the private curriculum to be of a higher standard than the NHS. Take a page out of USA/Australia curriculums. 
 Various stages of fleeing might be an option for some, rest of us have to make do. Private healthcare, for patients AND doctors, is the only option.

                              <span>Hello 🙋‍♂️ I’m an F1 and so am still new to how pay works. I believe I have paid too much tax for the 23-24 financial year (due to locums) and that I should be due for a tax rebate. I’ve been on my HMRC online and it says “your income tax has not yet been calculated for 6 April 2023 to 5 April 2024” 
 When do tax rebates typically get paid out and how is it paid? Thank you!

                              <span>Training places 
 All specialities will trend towards how neurosurgery is today. Hyper competitive. Virtually impossible to obtain a training number post foundation for many years. This will force more and more doctors into locum work. 
 Locum work 
 The rise in foundation doctors not getting a training number, previous F3,4,5s etc, and IMGs will saturate the market to the extent that there will be very few locum opportunities, and the rate for locum SHOs will continue to fall. 
 Unemployment 
 Eventually the market becomes that saturated that essentially as an SHO who has just finished F2. You don’t have enough experience to secure a training number, and there are no locum opportunities. So what do you do? You’re essentially unemployed from a medical point of view. No fellowships, no trust grade jobs. All over subscribed. 
 I give it 2-3 years before doctors unemployed in hundreds if not thousands. What can be done? I’m not sure if I’m being honest. I hope the BMA has plans, because honestly this is a much bigger issue than FPR. Actually in effect FPR probably further drives this issue as better pay means less people leave, and it’s more attractive to IMGs that will further up the competition for training numbers and saturate the locum market. (I’m still pro-FPR obviously just looking at it from a different angle 🦀). 
 What do people think the answer is?
 All specialities have points in their self scoring for home grad preference? Massive increase in training numbers highly unlikely to happen. Increased number of trust grade jobs? 
 I really don’t know.

                              <span>I was pleased to be approved a job in London through the ifst programme for F1, though the email is clear that it’s very dependent on the receiving school having a place for you. I’m currently in a placeholder group in my original deanery and have heard a lot about trusts not getting funding/ wanting to find extra places etc. does anyone anecdotally know if people generally get jobs or if they know people who were approved but had to stay put?

                              <span>Unpopular opinion but I really think PAs are also victim in the whole situation and now that they are here, they exists, they have spent money, time and effort that they can never get back to get here, I feel that we should help to find a role for them to work with us. 
 A lot of the issue were raised regarding PA in primary care setting. Now that the government doesn&#x27;t want GP to issue fit note, why can&#x27;t this go to PAs instead? Extending fit note is such a tiring task on top of everything else. 
 What about going through clinic letters etc? Sure they can&#x27;t prescribe, but with their existing knowledge surely they can help aid us?
 Why can&#x27;t they discuss simple blood test results like Folate deficiency, or MSU that is positive in symptomatic patients on resistant empirical abx - - - which they can run through red flags of sepsis as per set protocol? 
 I really think there&#x27;s a place for PA to help us in primary care, and I really think we shouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on them. I&#x27;m sure a lot of them feel attacked, lied to, hopeless and I&#x27;m sure their mental health are severely affected.

                              <span>I know it varies but just looking for a rough idea. I was offered a phlebotomy job about 3 weeks ago, told they’d call back that week to confirm an offer with hours. Just got a call today where she confirmed the offer and said she would send my details to recruitment to start the process. 
 I haven’t been employed by the nhs before if that makes a difference. I did ask for a rough idea but she just said it depends how long everything takes. 
 I just want to know if it’s best to wait before I hand my notice in to my existing job (I would like a few weeks inbetween jobs if possible to do a driving course)

 Does anybody have a blue light card discount for Ocado that they don&#x27;t mind sharing with me? 
 I&#x27;m happy to offer any unidays or student beans discount codes in return.

                              <span>Finally have a start date for a position I interviewed for months ago. Was only waiting on occupational health, and they contaceted me today with a cancellation slot. Signed off without any adjustments needed, within an hour had my unconditional offer emailed and my manager was agreeing a start date! Funny how it takes months to get paperwork checked then an hour to get a start date lol Thankfully I&#x27;m being squeezed in before the 2nd so I&#x27;m on payroll and will actually get paid in May, very nice of my new manager to arrange.
 ​
 Any advice for a new starter? I&#x27;ll be admin staff on reception for A&amp;E specifically if that makes any difference, but general advice welcome!

                              <span>Hello 
 How should a candidate answer these questions for a B7 PM interview
 How will you make get different stakeholders on board in this role? - my approach is to talk about how I’ve managed challenging stakeholders but not sure it is the right approach 
 An example of when you have worked to address inequalities, either in patient or staff groups - my approach is to talk about when a team in an underserved area didn’t get the same equipments as one in other areas, but not sure it is the right approach. 
 Can someone help please with suggestions on how to answer these questions correctly.

                              <span>Hi, I asked my surgery for my summary care record and then I saw that I could get my detailed coded record on the nhs app, (I currently only have access to the minimum information).
 I just wanted to check, are these two separate things? The surgery sounded like my summary care record could take a while but I am wondering if getting the app access will be faster and if I should ask for that instead/as well. I don’t want to clog up my surgery with requests but I wanted to get the information asap as I think there might be some things I need to address and it seems like granting app access should be straightforward?

So we called them at 2am, we were told to wait downstairs near the front door, it&#x27;s been almost 5 hours and we&#x27;re still waiting! The swelling has got significantly worse but when we call we are just told the ambulance is on the way??

                              <span>My GP practice has made me aware that i have missed 4 appointments in the last 12 months and they said they were taking off their patient list, i tried to contest this on the grounds that i have severe mental health issues and have been asking for months for support with appointments etc. They won&#x27;t listen, anyway i got a letter from NHS and it states that the practice are removing me as in not in their catchment area. This is horrific as it isnt the truth at all, i live at the end of the street to the surgery and am indeed in the catchment area on looking into it further. My question is can they just do this and make up a random reason? As after tomorrow i have no GP. It has got my head all over.

                              <span>Looking for advice on getting an SAS / specialty doctor post in sexual health / GUM.
 I&#x27;m a GP by background (CCTed a few years ago), and have worked in a non clinical public health related job for the past year. I&#x27;ve got an interest in sexual health with a couple of previous GUM jobs during training and have done the DFSRH. A little out of date with it all now, but really enjoyed previous work in this area. 
 I&#x27;d really appreciate advice from anyone who has made the switch to a specialty (non-training grade) doctor in sexual health, either full-time or alongside GP. Particularly interested in how you ended up in this role, what level of experience is needed, and how I can improve my chances of getting a post. 
 If anyone is willing to have a chat or offer some advice on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>A major landmark study to be published by The Lancet reveals that global immunization efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives – or the equivalent of 6 lives every minute of every year – over the past 50 years. The vast majority of lives saved – 101 million – were those of infants. 
The study, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), shows that immunization is the single greatest contribution of any health intervention to ensuring babies not only see their first birthdays but continue leading healthy lives into adulthood. 
Of the vaccines included in the study, the measles vaccination had the most significant impact on reducing infant mortality, accounting for 60% of the lives saved due to immunization. This vaccine will likely remain the top contributor to preventing deaths in…</span>

 Why 2 EM rotations ? It makes no sense. Almost all rotations taking you to 2,3,4 hospitals. 
 So dysfunctional.

 I’ve read the book, done some practice papers, all the online teaching stuff, but I’m terrified that I will fail. Any advice on what to focus on in terms of key exam questions/ scenarios that come up. 
 Thanks 🙏

                              <span>The GMC has issued standards of behaviour for doctors when engaging on social media. Apparently everybody has read it but it&#x27;s here for ease of reference: https://www.gmc-uk.org/professional-standards/professional-standards-for-doctors/using-social-media-as-a-medical-professional
 Recognising that anonymity is a common feature of many social media platforms the GMC states: 
  
&quot;9 Bear in mind that content uploaded anonymously can, in many cases, be traced back to its point of origin. When communicating privately, including using instant messaging services, messages or other communications in private groups may also become public. We have a legal duty to investigate any concerns raised to us that reach our fitness to practise threshold.&quot;

                              <span>This is more of a rant than a post, but does anyone else feel overwhelmed and just confused with emails of the pre-employment checks for GP training (or any other training post)? I&#x27;m due to start GP ST1 in August 24 and in the last two weeks have been sent over 10 emails with various links and various forms to fill in. I am grateful for the job and I feel like I shouldn&#x27;t complain about this but I&#x27;m just lost in a sea of HR words and documents and waffle!
 As a little summary of the things I&#x27;ve been sent:
 - A welcome letter, a privacy guide to sign, a guide about how to use the &#x27;TIS&#x27; system, had to make an account on the TIS system, then complete Form A/B of Form R on the TIS system, and a joining form, and remember to change my revalidation body on GMC website to my new education trust but only 7 days before I start the new job not earlier than that, and register with RCGP but only once I&#x27;ve done form R so then they can give me a training number which I then need to use on the RCGP application but it must only be for a training post, make sure I&#x27;m on the GP performers list, do a pre-health declaration form where I also need to find a life time history of my vaccinations, register for a TRAC account, sort out DBS etc etc etc ........... sigh 
 Each individual form takes me ages to fill in aswell because of poorly worded questions or tasks where I need to dig out previous evidence etc. 
 Does anyone else feel this way?

 I was hoping to ask for advice regarding the inter foundation-school transfer appeals process. I applied for a transfer between F1 to F2, however this got rejected today. I wondered whether anyone had any advice on appealing. I applied under criteria 4. 
 Any advice would be appreciated - thank you so much!

 50% of the score for ST4 Psychiatry is dependent how you do compared to your peers in an OSCE-style exam which you can only sit once if passed.
 So scraped a pass? Never getting another chance at 25% of the total score.

                              <span>Hi guys! I hope you can shine some light on my dilemma. 
 I have recently been accepted for an MBA in a top business school with a 50% scholarship - which is still a big investment. For some context, I am an IMG doctor and I co-founded a startup in London after my foundation training which went well but never took off. Last year I decided that it was time to do something different and I applied for the MBA and took a Clinical Fellow post. During my Clinical fellow post (part-time) I rediscovered my passion for medicine and how nice it is to directly help people and I managed to get an IMT spot in the reserve list in an ok location. The MBA would give me a higher salary on a corporate job but it would take me away from medicine and I am not sure I am ready for it! I am thinking about declining or at least trying to defer the MBA offer to next year and do 1 year of IMT to see how I feel. Everyone that I spoke with told me that I would regret my choice and that I am romanticising medicine as I haven&#x27;t been full-time in a long time. 
 I want to hear your opinion on that, especially from doctors and consultants who like what they do. Is it that bad? What about when you become a consultant? Am I making the wrong decision?

                              <span>Well, I could not have expected this when I started off as a medical student nor at any time after I entered the Specialist Register. 
 Today I went to see one of my male in-patients on the psychiatric ward. He was previously informed that I would be seeing him at a certain time. I was then told that he was busy masturbating. I asked someone to ask him to clean up as I&#x27;ll be there in a few minutes, me thinking he&#x27;d be done by then. Minutes pass. I get to outside his room (door closed). Staff tell me &quot;He&#x27;s still at it.&quot; So I waited about 10 minutes outside of his room. Someone said I should knock and enter. I did not. I spoke with staff outside of his room for the 10 minutes. Then I had to depart for a meeting as I was now running late. He then opened the door to his room as I was about to depart and seemed to want to talk. I couldn&#x27;t as I was going to be late for the important meeting. I thought there was a funny side but off course said nothing of the sort. I breached no standard of practice as far as I am aware. 
 I am unable to reveal other details - and don&#x27;t ask why. I don&#x27;t know how staff knew he was still at it. 
 When one meets an unexpected first, one obviously wonders about what one would do if the situation presented itself again.

I don’t have much oncology working experience but am very keen to gain experience and pursue it as a career. What sort of questions might they ask in the interview (specifically clinical scenarios) and what sort of resources have you guys used to prepare? Thanks for the help!

                              <span>Seems like a lot of people on this subreddit are very pro-CCT and flee, but was curious if most people expressing these views are ST4+? 
 Currently an ST1 and training&#x27;s been alright - it&#x27;s shielded from a lot of NHS bullshit, but you&#x27;re still working for the NHS. 
 Ophthalmology is switching to a new curriculum next year, but I&#x27;m skeptical this will significantly reduce training length. At the moment, I&#x27;m anticipating to CCT in probably 7-8 years after all of ST and ?fellowship assuming I stay 100% and pass all my exams/expected competencies in a reasonable time frame. 
 I know people have talked about going to Australia or the Middle East, but frankly I&#x27;m not that keen on the latter, and if everyone&#x27;s thinking of going to Australia or Canada after CCT-ing - what is the landscape even going to look like for me when I flee 8 years down the line? 😅 I do predict there will be healthcare shortages, but I would think locally, they&#x27;d also be looking to expand medical school/training places to accommodate in the next decade too. Is the prospect of CCT and flee as an ST1 even realistic?
 Also, I know ophthalmology is one of the more lucrative specialties, so surely there must be some barriers in place to emigrating vs a specialty that has a more supportive role (e.g. rads, anaes).

                              <span>I&#x27;m an F1, started in a new department a couple weeks ago. There&#x27;s a rule here that we aren&#x27;t allowed to take annual leave when the consultant in our subteam is on-call or post on-call (even if we are just working a normal day on the ward).
 Just wondering if there any rules proving this is a breach of our contract? Quite a few of my annual leave days have been/will be rejected because of this and its making it very difficult to plan time off/holidays to meet my friends :((
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi guys, got a place with Worcester TERS GP training, just wondering if anyone has any insight into the jobs in Worcester (looks to be mainly paeds, T&amp;O, ENT and O&amp;G) and the jobs like psych and palliative med and their GP placements in general. Also wondering what everyone else thinks of the jobs for their preferencing :)

                              <span>Hi, my MSRA rank was 6900, and I haven’t received a job offer yet. I&#x27;m wondering if all the positions have been filled, or if we should wait for further job offers. Any idea what the rank and score were for the last person who received an offer? It&#x27;s quite overwhelming to prepare for the exam for the third time

As an FY2 with plans to become a GP, I can see a future where pts are triaged or maybe even diagnosed automatically and I don’t know how I feel about it.

                              <span>Question regarding rota - I’m not a BMA member and my local junior doctor bma rep couldn’t help. I’m working 8-6 Thursday and Friday, 8-8:30 Saturday, 8-8 Sunday, bank holiday Monday, then 8-6 Tuesday - Friday. Does the bank holiday count as splitting up the shifts and therefore no zero day is needed? I have this on a couple of other occasions (working Thursday through to the following Friday, but without the bank holiday) and after raising this (for a few months), I’ve been given the Monday as a zero day to break up the 9-day stretch. However they are refusing to give a zero day on the week with a bank holiday. They also state because I moved the working weekend I’m not owed a zero day (I moved the weekend before they agreed to give me any zero days at all, so I’d argue if I cancel my swap I need my zero day, then reinstate the swap). Note, the working pattern given above is the original rotation (as if the weekend had not been swapped). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.
 Also, do the swaps also have to comply with rotation rules? Because I had no zero day to swap, where I’ve swapped my weekend to is now a 9-day stretch instead.

Have attempted intubation under supervision like about 8-9 times so surely I should have had some success by now. I am ok with simpler airway things such as masking for pre-oxygenation and can get a good seal. And there’s so many wires and lines and I find myself struggle to follow simple instructions a lot of the times such as putting the brakes on the bed (I find myself thinking how do I even do this) or working the anaesthetic chart (I am scared of putting the wrong information such as doses as there’s so …</span>

                              <span>I received a job offer for CT1/2 non training role in one of the hospitals so far away from where I live. The job is excellent and will help me boost my portfolio, and perhaps I could use it to apply for ST3 plastics surgery. 
 I am not able to afford the cost of finding a new place (paying deposit and rent) as well as paying for my current rent as my contract is due to end in June. I have asked if the trust could help with the relocation and they said that unless you are post covers more three years or so, the trust won’t be able to support you with the relocation.
 I am expected to start as soon as possible and have already signed my contract.
 I asked them if they could advise me on what to do and have only received details of the real estate agents around the area. 
 I have also asked if I could postpone my start date and haven’t received any response yet
 I am worried that they will withdraw the offer 
 Would appreciate your input/ any suggestions regarding this

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be honest, this is my ONE holiday so I cbf going through MindTheBleeps sea of information. It would be so amazing if you could provide just a checklist of shit that I MUST know or else i&#x27;d be booted. I&#x27;m guessing stuff like ABCDE for Emergencies (tbh I have no clue how to even insert a nasal cannula for O2 and how to work a O2 tank fml). What else? 
 NB Baseline: I did extremely shit in Med school (multiple repeat years) but somehow eventually graduated. I am aiming to just not be kicked out of FY-1.

                              <span>Hi everyone I am a paediatric doctor who works in ED quite often. A regular attender 14y old YP with suicidal ideation few week ago called me a P**i behind my back and demanded they want a white doctor when I refused to discharge them without camhs assessment she was told off by the staff members apparently. I actually didn&#x27;t know about this until they represented again and they have an alert I look back at the clinical records documenting clearly they were racially abusive towards me. I didn&#x27;t have to see them this time as one of the other doctors offered to see them. However quite a few times I am the only available senior in the night shift. What are my rights here given the perpetrator is a minor. If they are not in life threatening situation can I refuse to see incase they present again and I am the only person available/ need to senior review?

                              <span>Please can any one explain to me what actually happened to Doctors pay. Other workers in the NHS are put on AFC which places them in bands. Nurses start as Band 5, physician associates start as Band 7 which makes them to currently earn more than FY doctors and some CT doctors. 
 I learnt that doctors chose not to be part of the AFC and chose a different pay structure. This made FY doctors&#x27; salary to be actually at Band 5 level where as If doctors were part of AFC they would have been placed to start atleast as Band 8A. So why are starting with a band 5 salary? 
 Is it better to go back to the AFC like other staff? Is the different pay structure wee are using now going to benefit us anytime soon? ( would things fall back in place soon) 
 I am actually confused.

                              <span>I will be starting IMT in August with rotations in Northumbria and Durham. I have tried getting information on groups, and I was disheartened to see Durham doesn&#x27;t have a good reputation. Is anyone working in acute/gastro in Durham? What are your opinions? I am planning to commute from Newcastle.
 Any accommodation advice that works for both hospitals for a single doctor? Where do doctors usually live in Newcastle? I would really appreciate your input.
 Thank you.

                              <span>We’re paid less for doing more work for no respect. Since being appointed as surgical SpR, I’ve repeated a year for “inadequate progress” after 6 months of bullying from a senior. My new boss is no better. All I do is read for work and study only to get comments highlighting what I don’t know after questioning. At ARCP they bring up the fact you’re not operating when consultants refuse to let you do anything. My friends in the private sector laugh at me for staying. The contract sucks. The way our colleagues are treated sucks. What’s the point any more?

                              <span>I recently pivoted and decided to apply for a competitive specialty which I hadn&#x27;t previously planned for. Luckily, I completed a QIP in this specialty previously but the consultant in-charge is hands-off and slow to reply. 
 Long story short, abstract submissions for the last conference I can find that would allow me to present this QIP prior to specialty applications closes soon. I have tried contacting the consultant and other senior involved many times to ask if they are happy for me to submit an abstract, but they are taking their time to reply (which isn&#x27;t unusual for them). It&#x27;s my fault because I&#x27;m scrambling to build my portfolio last minute.
 Presuming the consultant doesn&#x27;t reply to me in time, is it appropriate for me to submit the abstract at the last moment without their permission? 
 I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m over thinking it, but this is likely my last and only opportunity to present this QIP to make it count for specialty applications.
 Thank you so much in advance for your advice!!

 Does the trust give you a new email/update your payslips etc automatically or is it a ballache to change over

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m 41/m.
 I&#x27;ve attended a private clinic today for a consultation, which was initially for an umbilicoplasty, but the surgeon diagnosed it as an umbilical hernia. He&#x27;s told me it&#x27;s not particularly serious in itself, but there is a risk of complications developing in the future.
 The quote from the private clinic is £5000. I have already £1600 saved which was the quoted price of the umbilicoplasty, so to go ahead with this treatment would require me to find £3400 from somewhere.
 My employer doesn&#x27;t currently provide private health insurance, so if I took out a policy myself, I don&#x27;t know if this would cover it.
 I have searched for information regarding treating this on the NHS, but from what I can see unless there are actual symptons, this isn&#x27;t available - can anyone advise?
 Thanks

                              <span>Very quick question. I’ve got Hashimoto’s disease and been under endocrine for 2 years. I was taken off Levo early on being under the team. Discharged in Jan being told my thyroid is fine. I’m declining fast so out of curiosity asked for all my results from 2022 onwards. Had them sent to me noticed only my TSH was reported. 
 I went to my GP to ask for my thyroid panel to be done and she also cannot see any bloods for T4, T3 etc. Only TSH. She was really confused. 
 I’ve been fuming thinking this hasn’t been requested in two years but found a photo of two blood forms I had for 2023 all requesting full thyroid panel. In one of the matching dates to results even my TSH is missing…
 Can labs just not be done?

                              <span>I have been meaning to schedule an appointment with my GP for a clinical referral so I wanted to set up my NHS app. I confirmed my identification with a video reciting the four characters on screen. It has been eleven days since submitting this and I still haven&#x27;t had my ID confirmed? 
 I&#x27;m just curious if anyone else has had to wait for such a long time? On the official website it suggests that the ID would be checked within a few hours, which seems alarming as I hadn&#x27;t been provided with that information upon application.
 Many thanks,

                              <span>When it comes to lack of capacity (mental capacity act), information on this is in the area of mental illness very vague.
 I fully understand what lack of capacity is and common conditions involve brain injury, learning disabilities, dementia etc. I understand it involves a persons ability to make decisions, remember information long enough to make a decision, communicate their decision, and so on.
 But I’m specifically asking about mental health conditions and when and how they affect a persons capacity.
 I can’t seem to find any information online, except Schizophrenia and Bipolar commonly can affect a persons capacity.
 Can someone explain how certain mental health conditions can affect a persons capacity and deem them as having lack of capacity, not just conditions mentioned above.
 For example, I understand that when someone suffering severe Anorexia is at severe risk of harm they can be deemed as lacking mental capacity.
 But when does lack of mental health capacity apply to other mental illnesses, and what factors determine this? Like can someone suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder be such a risk that they would be deemed as lacking mental capacity, and if so, what behaviours would lead to this decision?

 Also, if I have two separate claims can I use one for one claim and one for the other claim?

 I am due to start my first job in Adult mental health (complex mental health issues) and I am fully aware of safeguarding procedures and protocols (infact, it’s something I take seriously as I suffered abuse growing up). I know any concerns about possible abuse have to be documented in full detail, as soon as possible, but one thing that is never mentioned or clearly defined is whether to openly ask a patient about regular bruising and injuries, or whether you just document your concerns after a session. 
 I am asking because I know someone who was in a domestic violence situation a few years ago and also at the time attending psychology therapy. She isn’t in that abusive situation anymore but at the time she was spoken to by (I think) adult…</span>

 I&#x27;ve explored doing the foundation degree in mental health, with a view towards Occupational Therapy eventually, but it seems my trust are not willing or able to fund it. It also takes me away from the lived experience aspect of my current role which is important to me and one of my main skills. But roles higher than a b3 in Peer Support/lived experience are hard to find too. 
 Does anyone have any advice at all?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a ward clerk that&#x27;s looking to join a union; not for any pressing matter, just given the political climate in the UK. The big 3 that get mentioned are Unison, Unite and GMB but the thing that&#x27;s making me hesitate about them is that Unison &amp; Unite seem to list every other hospital profession under the sun specificaly as staff they cater to but ward clerks are lumped into the &#x27;and other admin staff&#x27; category; and GMB seems to be workers in general with no specialisation. On one hand I get it, ward clerks are comparatively low in numbers compared to most other hospital roles, but on the other hand I want to know that a union will be looking out for us just as much as they do for the roles with big numbers.
 Open to any advice on which union might be best for ward clerks and if there&#x27;s any other unions to suggest please do.

                              <span>I am a part of team that is creating a healthcare based app. We are on the ground floor of our startup and am trying to put together a medical library API for the app to pull information from. I wanted input about what diagnosis is lacking data for our MVP of this product. Currently we are throwing around geriatrics, pregnancy, mental health, and chronic diseases. I would love the medical communities opinion on what would gain the most traction with customers for a medical API that provides medical standards.

                              <span>Recently I was in a diagnostic session with the consultant psychiatrist in my local NHS recovery team. My GP referred me to them for a PTSD diagnosis, CPA, talking therapies, and medication advice.
 I was taken aback during the latest session when the psychiatrist began really pushing me to look at going privately for talking therapies.
 I get that the NHS is crumbling - I work in the same NHS Trust - but it felt really wrong to me that an NHS professional should advocate for going against the founding principles of the NHS.
 Does anyone else feel that this is unethical?
 —
 Extra information: I have the distinct impression that the recovery service really doesn’t want to take me on because I need significant reasonable adjustments to their usual ways of working. My autism and ADHD impact my presentation of mental health symptoms, and I need lots of additional time to process emotions and information. The local IAPT straight up rejected me as ‘too complex,’ and told my GP to send me to recovery. But it feels that rather than adapt and adjust, recovery want to find any reason to reject me too.

                              <span>Most doctors work hand in hand with drug companies, so prefer to issue prescriptions. There seems to be a culture where by medical professionals are not allowed to express evidence led views which go against drug companies. 
 Example 1: 
 Bunion Repair
 Bunion repair by Bianchi, Italy or Harley Street &#x3D; No screw, 5 minute procedure, brilliant. No pharma company involved.
 Whilst Bianchi is a superior reoair, standard NHS bunion repair &#x3D; Invasive procedure using a purchased medical device (screw).
 Example 2:
 Inguinal hernia repair
 Desarda technique &#x3D; A strip of external oblique is stitched to inguinal ligaments and internal oblique. Wonderful natural muscle graft. 
 Whilst desarda is superior, NHS repair &#x3D; A piece of purchased polypropylene stitched into your abdominal wall. YUCK
 Example 3
 Heart stents &#x3D; Research shows that the vast majority of operations brought no benefit in stable patients. But the surgeries were arguable performed due to the stents being a medical product was being pushed and purchased. 
 Example 4
 Fasting. 
 The health benefits are endless. Reverse insulin resistance, autophagy etc etc
 Fasting doesn’t involve any prescriptions, so doesn’t seem to be recommended.
 How many GP’s/consultants prescribe a 10 day fast?
 
 I can go private and see doctors with views that differ from the masses. But are there NHS doctors out there that are able to have less than conventional views without being scalded.

                              <span>Hello all!
 Longtime lurker posting on a throwaway. 
 I&#x27;m an SHO grade doc working in Scotland just now. I was looking at ways to bolster my income and fell onto ear syringing. I have good experience in performing it, albeit not having attended any formal courses, and feel it&#x27;s relatively low risk as I intent to take a good history and ensure I&#x27;m not suctioning at a steatoma with my otoscope. A local dental practice I&#x27;m on good terms with (not my own dentist) have offered a chair a day a week to run a mini clinic. 
 Has anyone got experience in this market? I&#x27;ve been having difficulty finding any real info on indemnity around this. Most of the indemnity products I&#x27;ve found are aimed at companies/clinics with multiple practitioners. Further, does anyone know the situation with making the clinic compliant? I&#x27;ve read about needing CQC approval down south, but again, can&#x27;t find any info on Scotland. 
 Any input is welcome!

                              <span>I’m currently a CT1 in surgery and I’m four years into medicine. I’ve done nights regularly for three of the four years. I’m still disablingly scared of them, even if I’m actually OK on the actual stretch. My current job has quite a few nights but workload is generally okay, so my anxiety is not bad but it’s certainly problematic. I find myself trawling the ED track board for hours before my shift predicting who I might have to see or not. Advice is never too far away but I am so scared of appearing shit that I prepare and over prepare. There really is no point trying to predict referrals as I know what to do with most of them anyway, but it’s a compulsion I can’t stop. 
 My next rotation will be in a speciality I have little knowledge on, but I will be covering wards AND referrals overnight. I’m scared I’m going to perpetually be a wreck. I sometimes get fleeting thoughts of calling in sick so I don’t have to deal with it - I never, ever do, but it’s so tempting sometimes that I’m ashamed to say that sometimes the thought lingers a bit too long in my head. 
 It doesn’t help that my sleep is almost universally shit on them, and my eating isn’t much better. 
 Grateful for any help/tips/reassurance that this can pass, and I can trust myself a bit more.

                              <span>Thought I’d ask the hive mind! I’m applying for anaesthetic core training next year and would ideally like to be placed in either Oxford or Wales deanery. That said, I really want the Oxford University Hospitals rotation. I am just wondering how it all works. Am I able to apply to both and see which rotation I get before accepting my offer? Or is it deaneries first and then you choose your rotation and get allocated according to rank like the FY programme? I would take virtually anywhere in Wales tbh but if I knew for sure I’d been allocated OUH’s rotation in Thames Valley, I’d take that instead. Appreciate that this is all hypothetical and at the end of the day I’d take any post I get regardless but just wondering how it works. Thanks

                              <span>Yet another incoming FY1 here. Basically I have a 2 year gap between graduating and starting F1 in which I did nothing medicine-related. I feel like I&#x27;ve forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn&#x27;t that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don&#x27;t remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.
 Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO&#x27;s (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I&#x27;ve been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I&#x27;ve also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I&#x27;ve contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? 
 Just for a little more info: I’m starting on gen surg. Also I&#x27;m hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I&#x27;m honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I&#x27;m working a 9-5 office job which I&#x27;m looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. 
 Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I&#x27;m ready to put my best foot forward and I’m honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound. Thank you so much🙏

                              <span>Hi everyone, incoming fy1 here interested in physics, maths and engineering related specialties. What sort of pathway could I go down to explore these topics more in medicine? I understand radiology has a decent amount of physics and there’s certain specialties like nuclear medicine to consider, both of which interest me a lot. I am just wondering what other things I could be doing alongside going into these specialties that could get me into a field that has a decent balance of medicine and physics/engineering. I have considered PhD programs to do with biomedical engineering that might lend to a more academic career, or ones that I could do alongside my radiology training, would like to know more about this.
 Would love to know if anyone here has gone down such a route or if anyone knows anything about it. Thank you.

 I advised her to ask for GP specifically to plan referral.
 She filled in an online form then was called back by a ………BIOCHEMIST ……….who advised otc medication. 
 Fair enough introduced herself as such but ….. a biochemist- undifferentiated patients??????

 Is there any good resources that people know of as maybe a reference or something to read in my spare time that will help my clinical knowledge on paediatrics?
 I cover the wards, paeds ED, NICU and postnatal wards during this rotation.

                              <span>People ask me what I want to specialize in and I say Histopath with rads in close second and the first question they have is about AI and that diagnostic rads and histopath may become obsolete with AI. From what I have seen so far from tasters in both specialties, AI is nowhere near even replacing doctors in rads or path and the clinical context is super important when producing reports of either CT scans or reporting microscopic slides which I don’t see AI deal with the nuances of anytime soon. I get asked this question so much that I feel it probably may even end up being an interview question when I make my application. But at the same time because I get asked this question a lot (by other doctors), perhaps there is some truth to it?
 What do the radiologists and pathologists here have to say about this? Interested in hearing your thoughts.

                              <span>For context, I am not a consultant/GP, have been qualified and working as a doctor for 7 years. Will be keeping this vague for identifiability purposes.
 A friend of mine runs a food and drink business. They&#x27;re expanding to several other countries after some success in the UK, including the USA, Europe, and Asia.
 One of the regulatory bodies has different allergen standards (I.e. acceptable concentrations), which has highlighted some issues and changes they&#x27;ll have to make to sell some of their food there.
 They&#x27;re looking for a doctor to essentially take the info regarding some of these issues, collate some evidence around them, and sort of explain it all to the board of their company, and attempt to quantify some risks for them. Not to necessarily say &quot;this is medically fine&quot; or &quot;go full steam ahead with production&quot;, but more to explain some of the issues from a medical standpoint and the repercussions should something go wrong.
 Any risk would theoretically be covered by their indemnity and lawyers, and a document would be prepared stating that they&#x27;ve consulted a doctor for advice but that the company is entirely responsible and culpable for their own decisions
 My questions boil down to is this an acceptable thing to do? 
 I&#x27;m not an expert in any regard, and I&#x27;m still a junior doctor. They&#x27;re asking because we are friends is all.
 Is there anyone out there who&#x27;s done something similar for a company/in a commercial setting? Would it be bonkers to consider doing this (essentially it boils down to a literature review turned to lay language)? Would an indemnity provider like MDU have specialised cover for this sort of thing or?

                              <span>Hi everyone I am using a throwaway account as I do not want to be identified I am an incoming f1, rounding up the final bits of med school, elective on the way 
 I have been in a long term relationship throughout med school with my partner who I am now culturally/ traditionally married to. We just haven’t done a religious / white wedding yet . We were planning on doing this April 2025
 I have just found out I am pregnant. This was not planned and is coming as a total shock/surprise . Yes we did use contraception but as I have learnt these can also fail My husband is very supportive and I know he will be a great dad
 I am just very anxious about it all. I am wondering if starting f1 whilst pregnant is a good idea . I am a graduate student so having a baby was definitely a plan in the near future . Initially taking a year out after F1 or F2
 I am also worried on the financial strain this will put on my husband as by the time I am due I will not be entitled to the nhs maternity pay 
 I am just wondering if I should just postpone f1 to next year altogether? My due date at the moment is late December/ early Jan so I could technically finish the first rotation 
 Fy1 is already hard enough and I’m just worried I will not be able to cope.

                              <span>With everything going around the media and forums I’m at a crossroads - nearly finished training and getting on a bit age wise. 
 Probably going to complete training and leave the profession because I’ve realised that nothing will ever change no matter how hard I work and whatever I do to try to make the system better will just cause push back on me - so there’s no point. Have learnt this the hard way every year so far as a doctor - nobody wants improvement they only want to perpetuate the status quo and crush any challenge to authority or even open discussion. 
 The NHS can have its way and just employ under qualified robots to do it’s willing as per the way of the world these days. Maybe outsource healthcare to a call centre in India? Robot consultations as is the way in the USA. 
 Anyway - does anyone actually know a tradesperson earning £50-60k/y? I’d rather cut my losses and go back to college despite having postgrad degrees on top of medical training. 
 Has anyone successfully started a business like aesthetics or even non medical and made it succeed? 
 Is there any hope at all for the profession because I’m not hearing anything positive at all and it feels very much like the government don’t want or need doctors and in the UK the government IS the NHS. And the overseas market for UK doctors is saturated. 
 Do any senior doctors actually want to change the system? And do they understand what your junior ‘colleagues’ are going through (ie not just robots to do what you tell them but also thinking and intelligent humans wish to contribute)?

 Have been thinking about future career prospects and having done further reading, ophthalmology seems interesting. Problem comes with the fact I have done basically nothing in medical school other than pass my exams ☹️ (no awards/poster presentations). I realise and am willing to put in a lot of work during my foundation training. Question is: is it possible? And if so, where do I start?
 Would appreciate any help/advice that you guys can offer!

 Should I be feeling this insecure so close to the end? 
 Still find myself making silly mistakes, nothing untoward happening to the patients but still dumb mistakes/oversights that I catch later and spend the day ruminating about. 
 I get good feedback from juniors and consultants but I don’t think they tend to notice what I’m up to being a senior trainee.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the pleasure at working at many different hospitals. Which means I&#x27;ve worked with many different blood transfusion labs and feel that their approach to group and save samples is incredibly hard-line. 
 At this point, I&#x27;d like to point out I am very aware of what I&#x27;m asking for when I request a blood transfusion and I do have a genuine appreciation for the risks involved and for the potential for catastrophic mishaps.
 However, I&#x27;ve seen multiple occasions where samples have been rejected (often at the disservice of the patient) for extremely rigid rules that are completely inflexible. This leads to repeated stabs which are unpleasant for the patient or, at its worst, a delay in transfusion of cross matched blood. 
 What are your feelings on the threshold for rejecting G&amp;S samples?

                              <span>Offered a job in a hospital which has a lot of PA’s, reading the BMA advice ahead of time. In the BMA MAP scope, it says teaching is not to happen unless it falls within the safe parameters of working for MAPS. Does this mean things both within the green and orange boxes?
 For example, in psych, the green for MAPS is physical healthcare related only. So does this mean PA can teach related to performing a physical exam, but shouldn’t be teaching things like MSE/History taking? 
 Likewise, O&amp;G, orange box is refit or replace vaginal pessaries. Can they be teaching doctors how to do so?
 Has anyone been asked to arrange teaching programmes involving PA as educators and if so how have you organised this so it’s appropriate?

                              <span>Are there any enterprising prompt engineers on this sub? I’m trying to create a prompt that will reliably get ChatGPT to spit out somewhat reasonable reflections to pad out my portfolio with. The best I’ve managed to come up with is:
 “You are a medical doctor writing a reflective piece to include in your logbook. The case that you are reflecting on is [insert scenario] and the learning points that you want to take away are [insert learning points]. The reflective piece should be between 500-1000 words and should be based on the Gibbs reflective cycle. Keep a professional tone but inject some evidence of empathy throughout the text” 
 I’ve been getting middling results with this and was wondering if anyone has any pointers on how to improve the prompt? 
 Edit: totally on board with the responses about 500-1000 words being way too long. My initial plan was to just pad it with so much stuff nobody would bother reading it to be honest!

                              <span>I was assigned a community placement in psychiatry for my GP training. When I tried to get a fob to access the car park, I was told that because I&#x27;m only there for 4 months, I&#x27;m not eligible for a fob. When I asked the admin team where I was supposed to park, they told me to park on the roads nearby. The placement is in quite a deprived area, and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable parking on the roads a few minutes walk away. So I parked in the patients&#x27; car park a few times, and was issued a £100 fine.
 I ended up telling the consultant that I&#x27;m under about the whole situation, and he was very indignant about it. Sent an email to the admin team straightaway and I got a car park fob the next day. In hindsight, should have told the consultant about it a lot sooner.
 Just really nice to have your consultant stick up for you!

                              <span>Hi guys
 My current job has a 3 month notice period. I was just wondering, would I be put at a disadvantage if I were to apply for Medical Lab assistant role with a 3 month notice period? For example, someone might be able to start sooner. Is that taken into consideration? Of course this is assuming I did well in the application/interview and ticked all the boxes etc.
 I&#x27;m wondering whether to just hand in my notice period and start applying

 So about two months ago I contacted the cqc about the hospital i work in. They did a suprise visit about two months later ward is under threat of closure. The annoying thing that is despite this the same issues are still going on, when the cqc do a suprise visit do they have to give reasons as to why? and what prompts them to do suprise visits

 Please I&#x27;ll like to ask if there is a possibility of switching from the position of a healthcare support worker to an administrative role within the NHS. Thanks.

                              <span>I’ve been given two separate blood forms from two consultants, requesting for different things to be tested (one is some baseline stuff, the other is just for iron/ferritin).
 What happens if I take two blood forms into the blood centre? Will I need two vials of blood taken, or can the blood forms be “combined” somehow so everything is tested in one go?
 Sorry if this is a stupid question. I have a lot of anxiety around blood tests and it helps me a lot to know what to expect!

                              <span>Hi guys, I’m waiting for hemithyroidectomy since 12th Jan, I’ve been told by ENT doctor that it’s been put down as urgent (suspected cancer, biopsies were inconclusive, I have trouble breathing, swallowing etc.) and waiting time is up to 12 weeks. Well, it’s already been 12 weeks, I’ve got a “follow up” appointment booked for 3rd May, I’ve called them up and I’ve been told I haven’t been put down for any procedure in the system :) I’ve called them once before mid March and everything was fine, they just told me that I don’t have a date for the op yet and that’s it and now that. Does anyone know where can I complain or what can I do so they’ll actually get it together? It’s been months of stress and anxiety. Thanks in advance x

                              <span>Every time I am in the NHS system, at some point you are put into a holding pen of sorts at one stage. That is absolutely fine and I appreciate the NHS.
 However the simplest service step of just saying, &#x27;the wait will be about 30 minutes, you need to wait for the doctor&#x27;, or even &#x27;the wait could be 4 hours because we only have 1 ### but you need to be here in case we get you in earlier&#x27;. 
 People just want to know something, so they can relax. But you&#x27;re forced to awkwardly approach staff milling about and ask, which makes you look impatient. When you just want some idea of what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>Hi so I’m graduating from my Bsc in biomedical science this year, and I’ve applied to the STP for clinical neurophysiology. I was wondering what are my options to continue a career in neuroscience and get lab accredited if I don’t happen to get into the STP? I understand there’s always other masters courses without the clinical training aspect but I really want a career in the NHS and to work in healthcare. Also just fyi my Bsc is not an IBMS accredited degree so I don’t have any certification to work in a lab once I graduate. I feel like the STP is my best chance at kickstarting my career so I need to have a backup if it doesn’t work out this year. Please help!

                              <span>We visited a hospital recently, and in so many corridors and wards staff are just milling about, not really speaking to patience. There seems no sense of urgency but everything I hear is the NHS is at breaking point, yet no one in the hospital seems busy?

 Please help us understand your views and experiences in relation to the role of Physician Associates (PAs) in general practice settings by completing our survey by Fri 10th May.
 The survey has been developed by the RCGP, following direction from RCGP Council, but is being conducted independently by Research by Design, an independent research agency.
 Your response will help us to understand more about how PAs are currently working in general practice as well as GP views on the benefits and challenges associated with this. We are also seeking your input on what framework and parameters should be in place to ensure that PAs working in general practice can do so safely and effectively, and what guidance is needed from RCGP.
 I know you&#x27;re all really busy, but the survey should only take 20–25 minutes to complete, and is really important, so please do take part if you can. We are keen to hear from as many members as possible to ensure we can gain a good understanding of views across the UK.

Now that the ranking is open for the rotations, it’s quite confusing especially which GP surgeries to choose in that area. Also what are heft rotations like? Any inputs would be very much appreciated, thank you!

                              <span>Hello! My question is as above. We are an IMG couple and is my husband is applying to FY2 Standalone Program which will start this August 2024. I plan to apply for the 2nd round of GP training which will open on July and will start Feb. 2025. 
 Is it feasible that we both do this if we have a 5 year old child? And we will all be moving to the UK mid-July before FY2 starts. 
 I’m concerned regarding our schedule and it its feasible to manage being hands-on with our son or if it would be very busy and if its advisable I apply to GP training once my husband is done with FY2. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all. 
 A benign mass was found in my breast a few months ago but I’m really nervous as I feel like I’m being pushed toward surgery. 
 I’ve had appointments set for days I’ve informed the staff I can’t make, appointment times moved without consultation, and they want to make a 5cm incision on my breast (either around my nipple or near my armpit) but won’t tell me where they’re going to cut into me until after I’m under (I’m not a very big person that will be a significant portion of my breast). There’s been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I’ve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn’t use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I’m not even sure if I’m going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I’m really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the “usual surgery risks” (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). 
 I’ve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don’t have have savings as they’ve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can’t tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement. I’m incredibly anxious about this whole thing as I don’t really have a support network outside of my care team. If anyone could share their own experiences with breast clinics in the UK I would appreciate it.

                              <span>I (30sF) had a relationship for over 10 years with my ex (30sM) broke up 3 years ago.
 It ended badly. He took my home and my possessions. Cheated, was abusive. He sexually assaulted me. I didn&#x27;t report it, so no official complaint is logged.
 He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.
 Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.
 I soon moved because I didn&#x27;t want to be anywhere near him.
 He&#x27;s contacted friends asking where I am.
 My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex&#x27;s part of the hospital. My relative&#x27;s mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.
 My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn&#x27;t understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.
 My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he&#x27;d be far enough away and chances low.
 Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.
 More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.
 My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.
 I don&#x27;t know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.
 Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen? Could this help stop him continuing to contact my family using the hospital?
 Any help is much appreciated.

                              <span>Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks&#x27; time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.
 Near the top of the letter is a phone number to &#x27;reschedule or cancel&#x27;. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to &#x27;reschedule or cancel&#x27;, it seems reasonable that if I don&#x27;t contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there&#x27;s a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.
 I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do, so I figured I&#x27;d ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven&#x27;t been able to get through to anyone.
 So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I&#x27;m unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?
 I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I&#x27;ve been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I&#x27;m terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.
 Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).
 Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.

                              <span>I am an undergraduate psychology student who has an interview for a placement in the NHS. I am curious about the benefits of taking this placement as it is unpaid, and I am concerned whether the advantages (such as potentially securing a job more easily after university) outweigh the costs (such as increased university debt).
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, for a few years I&#x27;ve been having recurring abdominal pain, which seems to be chronic gastritis as I have all the symptoms.
 I first brought this up to my GP in 2022, which resulted in me taking prescribed omeprazole for 3 months. After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what&#x27;s causing my stomach pain.
 Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were &quot;inconclusive.&quot; I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.
 This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.
 This has been going on for years and I&#x27;m frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements. What can I do???

I&#x27;ve been at my current doctors for 5 years &amp; they&#x27;re aware of my medical history. It says medical Condition 0. 
 I asked my doctors &amp; they asked me to put it in writing which I did. Does anyone know how long it will take to get my full medical history from birth if possible? Because I was really sick as a child. My mum told me had different medical issues which I later found out I didn&#x27;t. thank you.
 Thank you to everyone. I have my medical records now. 163 pages.

 My first day of being in this team I was told by my line manager that they didn’t really see a place for me and that they’d help me create a CV for another job.

 It seems GP across the country is in a dire situation, but I have been told it is &quot;better&quot; in London. 
 For fully qualified GP&#x27;s who are and have been working in London...
 How is it? 
 Is it sustainable? 
 Are there more &quot;opportunities&quot;, private or otherwise? 
 Do you get paid (alot) more in London? 
 Are there more partnership opportunities? How about getting into other industries such as branching into health tech / pharma? 
 Or perhaps going into more public health / regulation / policy? 
 For those outside of London, is it as bad as the press says it is? GPs going to food banks, or going to 
 I think the recent issues in GP have been making me strongly consider whether to remain in training or leave to enter a different speciality. 
 I figured getting some objective truth / advice from fellow GPs on here would be helpful.

                              <span>Hi all am a bit stuck with delays getting onto the performers list and having a nightmare with PCSE, would appreciate some advice about how I can try and get it sorted asap. I’m UK trained and CCT’d in Feb 2024. I hadn’t been told re: being on the PL as a registrar so tried to apply as qualified since mid January. Initially PCSE website was down so couldn’t do it, then my account got frozen and unusable, it took 6 weeks of emails and phone calls for them to sort. I finally got application put through and have been waiting another few weeks since. All this while, I managed to get a job on OOH bank contract but am being told I’m not allowed to take any work with them until on PL. I’m also concerned if this drags on further they’ll terminate my contract. I engaged BMA before but hasn’t seemed to help. I’m now almost 3 months post CCT and it’s causing me loss of income- I’ve drawn on savings for mortgage etc but the whole thing has impacted my finances and I’m pretty angry. Any help/advice much appreciated sorry if this comes across as ranty!

                              <span>Hi all, i am a gp ( recent cct). I love to travel , it’s something I truly enjoy doing. I am currently in Japan and have been here for the past 3 months, absolutely love the people and the culture, and planning to travel for least 12 months. I don’t want to keep coming back to uk and locuming for a couple of weeks and heading out again. Then it hit me , why not work remotely using a VPN . There must be way right, I mean we are living in 2024 not 1980, the world is so connected now. I heard that indemnity can be a headache ? I don’t understand why tho. What’s the difference between speaking to a patient in Japan as opposed to in my living room , if makes no sense to me. Has anyone done this ? Would really like to hear your thoughts. Thanks all 🙏

                              <span>TW for mention of death. 
 I apologise for asking such a blunt question, but I’ve always wondered about this and wondered if anyone can inform me. 
 I always think about the paramedic who informed me that my Mum had passed away, many years ago. She died in a very upsetting and traumatic way, and from what I understand, the visual would have been really upsetting. I did not see her. 
 I always think of him and I wonder what kind of support he would have been given. Is there an official process? Is there mandatory counselling given after incidents like this? 
 Thank you in advance, and apologies for the morbid question.

                              <span>I have a medical exemption card. When I went to get a prescription earlier, they said ‘and you have a pre-paid certificate right?’ And I said ‘no I have a medical exemption’ and they looked puzzled and said they have me down as pre-paid certificate. I showed my card, they then entered the correct type and all was fine. 
 What has now worried me is I’ve collected prescriptions a couple of times from here previously, one last week and one in January. I’m pretty sure I showed my card then or said I had a medical exemption. Any chance they wrote down the wrong type at one point and now that’s stored on my file? Could I get penalised by the NHS BSA if it looks like l’ve claimed on this when I haven’t? Maybe they’d see if I have a medical exemption and it’d be ok, but not sure how their checking system works. 
 I will go into the pharmacy tomorrow just to check with them, but thought I’d ask on here as it’s causing a little anxiety. Thank you

                              <span>Hi all
 Accepted on upcoming Aug entry to GPST. I already have my locality.
 I&#x27;m looking to get a mortgage. The broker says they need a contract prior to AIP/offer. Does anyone have past experience with when we would receive an offer (I&#x27;d imagine it might be very late) or any other advice regarding this.
 I would imagine even the specialist brokers for doctors would require a contract.
 Thank you

I’ve had only one primary case placement in my training so far, which was an honest nightmare (only enjoyable bit was the patient consultations, I used to dread interacting with the team- they were rude, easily irritable and honestly seemed like not coping with the workload themself which kinda was being taken out on trainees). I was at a point where I questioning my decision to be in GP training. Thanks to the weekly teaching group sessions at the time, I could understand that experience can vary greatly between practices and therefore decided it would be sensible to stay on to see how things go in my next primary care rotation. In between I’ve had two hospital rotations ( I changed to 60% from full time in ST2- mainly due to being burnt out after my GP rotation) where I have…</span>

                              <span>Everyone here will have worked in a hospital rotation of some sort. How many times do you hear the patient say “oh I went to my GP who told me to come in”. Everyone rolls their eyes at the silly GP sending people in because they’re lazy
 When you speak to the patient, a good proportion won’t have actually seen a doctor: - Some of them went to their practice nurse for a routine checkup - Some of them went to one of the PA or ACPs - Some of them called up their GP and couldn’t get past the “go to A&amp;E if you think it’s an emergency”
 Anyone else noticed this/got any thoughts? You never actually went to your GP, but it all gets lumped together as “why has their GP sent them in for THAT?!?!l 
 (Obviously goes without saying that shit and/or GPs exist, and everyone’s guilty of an embarrassing referral)

                              <span>Hi all. Wanted to get thoughts from people.
 I&#x27;m entering GP training in August. I really wanted an A&amp;E rotation as I want to work in A&amp;E occasionally as a GP. I&#x27;m interested in managing minor injuries, suturing, procedures etc. I know a lot of this is done by non doctors but I wanted to build up experience so I can do a lot of OOH work as a GP. However, I didn&#x27;t get my chosen ED rotation as there were only 3 to choose from...
 Does this limit my ability once I&#x27;m qualified if I wanted to spend a decent amount of time in ED as a GP?

                              <span>Hi I am not sure if I understood everything completely, that&#x27;s why I am writing this post. I hope someone correct me if I am wrong. I have seen that the fill rate for GP training for the previous years was always less than 100%. Does that mean that there are always unoccupied posts? If this is true, it means that an applicant can get an offer even if his MSRA score is very low

 I’ve accepted my GP offer at Stepping Hill and have been asked to rank GP practices in Stockport. 
 Does anyone have any experience of working at these GP practices? If so, which ones would you rank top 5 and which ones to avoid and why?
 Thank you in advance :)

                              <span>I am a GPST1, relatively de-skilled re asthma management and COPD as we have respiratory nurses that do the most of it. 
 ​
 I got confused re-dosages, escalation policy and when to use what 
 Nice/BTS/GINA State different things and dosages : so my questions are 
 ​
 -Any simplified escalation policy including dosages involved? 
 -Maximal dose of steroid per day (GINA states 2000, BTS/NICE 1000) 
 -Maximal dose of LABA. It&#x27;s officially 46 for Formoterol, but saw patients using more. 
 -What do you give if patient is on Fostair and reached 8 puffs a day (&#x3D;maximal dose of Formoterol 46mcg) and you wish to increase his inhaled steroids 
 -role of muntelukast in this story 
 -role of anti histamins (as resp nurses gives it at times as well) 
 -would you give combined LABA+Steroid(e.g. fostair) and also reliever therapy as salbutamol of not well controlled on maximal dose?
 ​
 Your help is IMMENSLY appreciated!

                              <span>I know this question has been asked a few times before, but what’s the best courses I can attend as a GPST? My current region is quite generous with their allocation so I’m hoping to make the most of the budget. I’ve done PCDS dermoscopy which was very useful and enjoyable.
 Also if there’s any that are not only useful but also CV boosters that would help too!

                              <span>A new oral vaccine for cholera has received prequalification by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 April. The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. 
“The new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. “The new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.”
WHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S.  
Vaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.  
There were 473 000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</span>

                              <span>Hear me out. My practice PC can barely run more than S1/AccuRx and a few chrome tabs (or one NHS Mail tab). If I try to open a PDF it&#x27;s russian roulette whether or not my screen will hang, and don&#x27;t even get me started on the arachaic Word referral doc system we still have going because that&#x27;s another rant in itself...
 I looked at &quot;My Computer&quot; the other day and saw that the PC I use has 8GB RAM. My iPhone has 6GB of RAM and all I use that for is reddit and ignoring my emails, but I digress.
 I found this the other day. An 8GB RAM upgrade for the PC I&#x27;m using. This would double my RAM, quadrouple my productivity and probably cure the viral URTI of the patient sitting in front of me if it tried hard enough - and all for the low, low price of £16.94.
 So tell me, someone, anyone, please, why shouldn&#x27;t I just purchase this and install it onto my practice PC? It would cost me less than a nice take-out dinner and serve me righteously for years to come!
 (PS: Do you think I would have to run this by the IT guy or do you think it&#x27;s cool if I just open &#x27;er up and giv&#x27;r? Srs answers only plz.)

                              <span>Hello GPs and supervisors, 
 I am currently GPST2 who is starting a placement at a UTC where there’s basically no GPs and obviously no GP trainers. It’s completely run by allied health care professionals. There’s a GP on-call remotely for advice and that’s all. 
 My question is: am I ok with working with no supervision? As per my understanding and the NHSE policy; GP trainees are to be supervised at all times when in GP practice. I don’t know if it’s the same with UTCs. 
 Advice and course of action appreciated.

The campaign advocates for ensuring universal access to quality health services, education, and information, as well as safe drinking water, clean air, good nutrition, quality housing, decent working and environmental conditions, and freedom from discrimination.

Countries that will receive kits in the coming weeks in this largest-ever global deployment include those currently severely impacted by cholera outbreaks, such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Syria, and Zambia. This programme will improve the timeliness and accuracy of outbreak detection and response by boosting routine surveillance and testing capacity and helping rapidly identify probable cholera cases. Critically, it will also help countries monitor trends and build an evidence base for future preventive programmes, supporting the achievement of national cholera control and elimination targets.</span>

Though there is a shift towards digital to make registering with a GP surgery easier and more convenient for both patients and practice staff, we haven’t forgotten the importance of developing a paper registration form for those who prefer not to or can’t use a digital service.</span>
