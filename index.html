This involved the use of an extensive network of teams, vaccinating at selected fixed sites at health facilities and outreach posts.

It is estimated that there are around a billion cases of seasonal influenza annually, including 3–5 million cases of severe respiratory illness. An estimated 290 000-650 000 deaths each year are due to seasonal influenza related respiratory disease, in addition to the deaths related to other influenza-related complications.

                              <span>Over 187 000 children under ten years of age were vaccinated with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) in central Gaza during the first phase of a two-round polio vaccination campaign, conducted between 1–3 September 2024. Vaccination coverage in this phase exceeded the initial estimated target of 157 000 children due to population movement towards central Gaza, and expanded coverage in areas outside the humanitarian pause zone.  

To ensure no child is missed in this area, polio vaccination will continue at four large health facilities in central Gaza over the next few days. Vaccine doses have been supplied to these sites to meet any additional needs.

While there are a number of tools available for investigating infectious disease outbreaks, this is the first unified, structured approach to investigating the origins of a novel pathogen. This framework aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive set of scientific investigations and studies. It is the first version of a “how-to” guide that will be updated as and when needed, based on feedback from users.

The number of reported cholera cases increased by 13% and deaths by 71% in 2023 compared to 2022. Over 4000 people died last year from a disease that is preventable and easily treatable. 
Forty-five countries reported cases, an increase from 44 the previous year and 35 in 2021. Thirty-eight per cent of the reported cases were among children under five years of age.
