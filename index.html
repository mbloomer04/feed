                              <span>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), of which WHO is a member, today issued a Food Insecurity and Malnutrition Alert for the Gaza Strip. The details are as noted below. 
Key highlights 
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has issued a stark warning today that the worst-case scenario of Famine is now unfolding in the Gaza Strip. Amid relentless conflict, mass displacement, severely restricted humanitarian access, and the collapse of essential services, including healthcare, the crisis has reached an alarming and deadly turning point. 
Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. Latest data indicates that Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City.
Recommended actions 

End hostilities
Ensure humanitarian access
Protect civilians, aid workers, and civilian infrastructure
Restore life-saving and multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance safely and with dignity
Restore the flow of commercial goods and local production capacities.

About the IPC
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is an innovative multi-partner initiative for improving food security and nutrition analysis and decision-making. By using the IPC classification and analytical approach, governments, UN agencies, nongovernmental organizations, civil society and other relevant actors work together to determine the severity and magnitude of acute and chronic food insecurity, and acute malnutrition situations in a country, according to internationally recognized scientific standards.
The main goal of the IPC is to provide decision-makers with a rigorous, evidence- and consensus-based analysis of food insecurity and acute malnutrition situations, to inform emergency responses as well as medium- and long-term policy and programming.</span>

The NHS is available to all so it&#x27;s really crucial that the content on the NHS website must be available to all.


It is the UK’s biggest health website with more than 50 million visits every month and the NHS videos on the website and You Tube Channel  attracted over 28 million views in 2020. This indicates just how vital the video content is to our audience who need to absorb important information quickly and easily.</span>

                              <span>The United Nations warns that the fuel shortage in Gaza has reached critical levels.  
Fuel is the backbone of survival in Gaza. It powers hospitals, water systems, sanitation networks, ambulances, and every aspect of humanitarian operations. Fuel supplies are needed to move the fleet used for transporting essential goods across the Strip and to operate a network of bakeries producing fresh bread for the affected population. Without fuel, these lifelines will vanish for 2.1 million people.  
After almost two years of war, people in Gaza are facing extreme hardships, including widespread food insecurity. When fuel runs out, it places an unbearable new burden on a population teetering on the edge of starvation.  
Without adequate fuel, UN agencies responding to this crisis will likely be for…</span>

                              <span>The World Health Organization has formally recognized the pivotal role of a number of heads of state and government in securing the adoption of the WHO Pandemic Agreement by the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2025. 
At a special event at WHO Headquarters in Geneva on 10 July 2025, plaques were presented to the representatives of two countries whose former and current presidents, His Excellency Sebastián Piñera, former President of Chile, and His Excellency Kais Saied, President of Tunisia, advocated for the Agreement from the outset. Certificates were also awarded to leaders of 25 other countries for their guidance and commitment throughout the negotiation process.
“The adoption by the World Health Assembly of the Pandemic Agreement was a historic moment in global health,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “But we would not have reached that moment without sustained political advocacy from the highest levels”. 
Countries whose current or former presidents or prime ministers were also recognized include Albania, Costa Rica, Croatia, Fiji, France, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Senegal, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
The Pandemic Agreement represents a global commitment to a more robust international health architecture, one that is grounded in equity, cooperation, and shared responsibility.
Political momentum behind the Agreement was galvanized in part by a commentary published in major international outlets in 2021, in which 25 heads of state and international organizations called for a pandemic treaty. 
Work has now begun to take forward key elements of the Pandemic Agreement, in particular on pathogen access and benefit sharing. This work is being led by an intergovernmental working group (the “IGWG on the WHO Pandemic Agreement”), which met for the first time this week.</span>

                              <span>Adriano Gazza, Multimedia team lead for the NHS website, explains how the principles of user-centred design can help create engaging video, animation and infographic content for the public that is clinically accurate.


It was only when I came to NHS Digital that I was exposed to the concept of user-centred design.


One of the frequent challenges in my previous creative roles was explaining why we needed to bear in mind specific considerations for the audience that a commissioner had not always recognised.


Often, clients submitted a request for a video without a strategic purpose. We would rely on brand guidelines where they existed, but this still didn’t answer the central question of why we should create things a certain way. This all started to change when I began to learn the principles of user-centred design.</span>

Ambassador Tovar da Silva Nunes of Brazil, co-chair of the IGWG Bureau guiding the negotiations, said the first meeting, that ran from 9-10 July, was a critical moment in the global effort to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. It followed the World Health Assembly’s landmark adoption on 20 May 2025 of the WHO Pandemic Agreement.

Last year we published our blog ‘What happens when we ‘sunset’ our APIs?’ in which Munish Jokhani explained how we actively deprecate (where we advise of our intention to retire the API while retaining all existing service levels) and retire our APIs, and the effect this had on developers. By working with our suppliers and engaging them early in the process, we found that we were able to agree and align the retirement dates so that we met our suppliers’ requirements.</span>

Historically, we have only represented NHS Digital APIs in our API and integration catalogue. The reason is that the Developer hub was set up as a space where API consumers can learn about the NHS Digital onboarding journey and identify the APIs which they’d like to onboard with. It made sense to only represent our NHS Digital APIs in there and aimed to avoid confusion or dilute our onboarding journey for external suppliers and partners.</span>

In the decade since the NHS Spine was launched, digital health and care services have become significantly larger, much more complex and more central to NHS provision. The Spine platform provides critical healthcare infrastructure and we must modernise to keep up with the demands being placed on it.</span>

                              <span>Brie Whyatt, Interaction Design Graduate, explains how the NHS App team improved the appointment booking process in the app by creating user stories, using the NHS digital service manual and doing usability tests to help patients and GP surgeries during this exceptionally challenging winter.


Many GP surgeries across the country offer patients the ability to book their appointments in the NHS App. Online appointment booking enables patients to access primary care digitally, which eases pressure on GP surgery staff, who are facing the extreme clinical challenges of the coronavirus pandemic during the already difficult winter months.</span>

                              <span>Tosin Balogun, Associate Interaction Designer for the NHS website, looks at how we design and how we try to make a difference.


It is pretty obvious to say that design changes people’s lives. If it didn’t, we wouldn’t spend so much of our time trying to get it right.


But the reality beneath that unoriginal claim struck home for me recently as I worked on a report tool, part of the replacement system for national cervical screening.


It’s not the most dramatic or heart-rending example of our impact – but is perhaps no less meaningful for that. It’s a small piece of work that speaks to the everyday reality we try to grapple with as interaction designers in the NHS.</span>

                              <span>Josh Healey, User-Centred Design Lead for the Register with a GP surgery service, explains how redesigning the first page of the service made it more accessible for everyone – and how they created a framework to measure impact.


General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in our communities. GPs treat common medical conditions, refer patients to hospitals and act as the first place many go to for health and wellbeing advice. This is why it is so important that everyone can register with and see a GP when they need to.</span>

Ensuring that the API platform is as self-serve as possible, with simple and reliable support provided when needed, is top of the list for our team. If our developers have a positive experience, they are more likely to use our APIs to develop cost-effective, digital services designed around the needs of our health and care professionals, patients, and the public.</span>

Good services don’t happen by accident. They are the result of a deep understanding of the people that will use the service. They are carefully crafted to help those people do what they want to do.</span>

                              <span>User researcher Fern Williams describes how we created a new paper patient registration form to complement the online ‘Register with a GP surgery’ service, allowing everyone to have a consistent user experience and leaving no one digitally excluded.


One of the guiding principles of the ‘Register with a GP surgery’ service is to be accessible and inclusive to all. Though there is a shift towards digital to make registering with a GP surgery easier and more convenient for both patients and practice staff, we haven’t forgotten the importance of developing a paper registration form for those who prefer not to or can’t use a digital service.</span>

A big part of early work on projects typically involves helping our colleagues to focus a bit less on the characteristics of their products and the requirements of their internal processes, and to instead start by involving users to understand their needs.


Therefore, it&#x27;s been interesting to work on projects that required our team to get deep into the weeds of the process in order to, ultimately, put the focus back on users.</span>

I joined the NHS App team on 23 March 2020, the day the UK entered full lockdown. This was my fourth and final placement as a user research graduate trainee and I was looking forward to taking on new challenges and gaining independence as a user researcher. I was not, however, expecting to do my entire placement from my bedroom.</span>

                              <span>Most prescriptions are still paper-based in secondary care. Business analyst Andy Harrison describes the technical groundwork we’ve laid to allow these settings to go digital.


The little green FP10 paper prescriptions have all but disappeared in primary care. 18 years ago, we launched the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) and it has since become an indispensable tool for primary care teams. Nearly all GP practices use it and about 95% of primary care prescriptions are now sent electronically. Last year, that amounted to 1 billion items dispensed using the service. It’s a safer, faster and more convenient way to prescribe.</span>
