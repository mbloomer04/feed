                              <span>I received an offer for an ST4 cardiology position in the East Midlands South, but the start date is listed as February 2025. Do these posts usually start in February? I thought most began in August. Can anyone confirm? Also, if anyone has any reviews about the cardiology training there, could you please share them?

                              <span>Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm an F1 and so am still new to how pay works. I believe I have paid too much tax for the 23-24 financial year (due to locums) and that I should be due for a tax rebate. I‚Äôve been on my HMRC online and it says ‚Äúyour income tax has not yet been calculated for 6 April 2023 to 5 April 2024‚Äù 
 When do tax rebates typically get paid out and how is it paid? Thank you!

                              <span>Training places 
 All specialities will trend towards how neurosurgery is today. Hyper competitive. Virtually impossible to obtain a training number post foundation for many years. This will force more and more doctors into locum work. 
 Locum work 
 The rise in foundation doctors not getting a training number, previous F3,4,5s etc, and IMGs will saturate the market to the extent that there will be very few locum opportunities, and the rate for locum SHOs will continue to fall. 
 Unemployment 
 Eventually the market becomes that saturated that essentially as an SHO who has just finished F2. You don‚Äôt have enough experience to secure a training number, and there are no locum opportunities. So what do you do? You‚Äôre essentially unemployed from a medical point of view. No fellowships, no trust grade jobs. All over subscribed. 
 I give it 2-3 years before doctors unemployed in hundreds if not thousands. What can be done? I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being honest. I hope the BMA has plans, because honestly this is a much bigger issue than FPR. Actually in effect FPR probably further drives this issue as better pay means less people leave, and it‚Äôs more attractive to IMGs that will further up the competition for training numbers and saturate the locum market. (I‚Äôm still pro-FPR obviously just looking at it from a different angle ü¶Ä). 
 What do people think the answer is?
 All specialities have points in their self scoring for home grad preference? Massive increase in training numbers highly unlikely to happen. Increased number of trust grade jobs? 
 I really don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôm currently in a placeholder group in my original deanery and have heard a lot about trusts not getting funding/ wanting to find extra places etc. does anyone anecdotally know if people generally get jobs or if they know people who were approved but had to stay put?

                              <span>Unpopular opinion but I really think PAs are also victim in the whole situation and now that they are here, they exists, they have spent money, time and effort that they can never get back to get here, I feel that we should help to find a role for them to work with us. 
 A lot of the issue were raised regarding PA in primary care setting. Now that the government doesn&#x27;t want GP to issue fit note, why can&#x27;t this go to PAs instead? Extending fit note is such a tiring task on top of everything else. 
 What about going through clinic letters etc? Sure they can&#x27;t prescribe, but with their existing knowledge surely they can help aid us?
 Why can&#x27;t they discuss simple blood test results like Folate deficiency, or MSU that is positive in symptomatic patients on resistant empirical abx - - - which they can run through red flags of sepsis as per set protocol? 
 I really think there&#x27;s a place for PA to help us in primary care, and I really think we shouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on them. I&#x27;m sure a lot of them feel attacked, lied to, hopeless and I&#x27;m sure their mental health are severely affected.

                              <span>What on Earth is happening with these wait times? Partner tripped down the stairs and her foot is swollen, 111 advised to call 999 and get an ambulance down. So we called them at 2am, we were told to wait downstairs near the front door, it&#x27;s been almost 5 hours and we&#x27;re still waiting! The swelling has got significantly worse but when we call we are just told the ambulance is on the way??

                              <span>My GP practice has made me aware that i have missed 4 appointments in the last 12 months and they said they were taking off their patient list, i tried to contest this on the grounds that i have severe mental health issues and have been asking for months for support with appointments etc. They won&#x27;t listen, anyway i got a letter from NHS and it states that the practice are removing me as in not in their catchment area. This is horrific as it isnt the truth at all, i live at the end of the street to the surgery and am indeed in the catchment area on looking into it further. My question is can they just do this and make up a random reason? As after tomorrow i have no GP. It has got my head all over.

 Why 2 EM rotations ? It makes no sense. Almost all rotations taking you to 2,3,4 hospitals. 
 So dysfunctional.

                              <span>The GMC has issued standards of behaviour for doctors when engaging on social media. Apparently everybody has read it but it&#x27;s here for ease of reference: https://www.gmc-uk.org/professional-standards/professional-standards-for-doctors/using-social-media-as-a-medical-professional
 Recognising that anonymity is a common feature of many social media platforms the GMC states: 
  
&quot;9 Bear in mind that content uploaded anonymously can, in many cases, be traced back to its point of origin. When communicating privately, including using instant messaging services, messages or other communications in private groups may also become public. We have a legal duty to investigate any concerns raised to us that reach our fitness to practise threshold.&quot;

                              <span>This is more of a rant than a post, but does anyone else feel overwhelmed and just confused with emails of the pre-employment checks for GP training (or any other training post)? I&#x27;m due to start GP ST1 in August 24 and in the last two weeks have been sent over 10 emails with various links and various forms to fill in. I am grateful for the job and I feel like I shouldn&#x27;t complain about this but I&#x27;m just lost in a sea of HR words and documents and waffle!
 As a little summary of the things I&#x27;ve been sent:
 - A welcome letter, a privacy guide to sign, a guide about how to use the &#x27;TIS&#x27; system, had to make an account on the TIS system, then complete Form A/B of Form R on the TIS system, and a joining form, and remember to change my revalidation body on GMC website to my new education trust but only 7 days before I start the new job not earlier than that, and register with RCGP but only once I&#x27;ve done form R so then they can give me a training number which I then need to use on the RCGP application but it must only be for a training post, make sure I&#x27;m on the GP performers list, do a pre-health declaration form where I also need to find a life time history of my vaccinations, register for a TRAC account, sort out DBS etc etc etc ........... sigh 
 Each individual form takes me ages to fill in aswell because of poorly worded questions or tasks where I need to dig out previous evidence etc. 
 Does anyone else feel this way?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I was hoping to ask for advice regarding the inter foundation-school transfer appeals process. I applied for a transfer between F1 to F2, however this got rejected today. I wondered whether anyone had any advice on appealing. I applied under criteria 4. 
 Any advice would be appreciated - thank you so much!

                              <span>From my research..becoming a GPwSI is done in your own time at your own cost.is that right ? Most of the advice is..go and sit in hospital clinics and get the competencies signed off. Why would this come at our own cost ?

                              <span>Hi guys! I hope you can shine some light on my dilemma. 
 I have recently been accepted for an MBA in a top business school with a 50% scholarship - which is still a big investment. For some context, I am an IMG doctor and I co-founded a startup in London after my foundation training which went well but never took off. Last year I decided that it was time to do something different and I applied for the MBA and took a Clinical Fellow post. During my Clinical fellow post (part-time) I rediscovered my passion for medicine and how nice it is to directly help people and I managed to get an IMT spot in the reserve list in an ok location. The MBA would give me a higher salary on a corporate job but it would take me away from medicine and I am not sure I am ready for it! I am thinking about declining or at least trying to defer the MBA offer to next year and do 1 year of IMT to see how I feel. Everyone that I spoke with told me that I would regret my choice and that I am romanticising medicine as I haven&#x27;t been full-time in a long time. 
 I want to hear your opinion on that, especially from doctors and consultants who like what they do. Is it that bad? What about when you become a consultant? Am I making the wrong decision?

                              <span>Well, I could not have expected this when I started off as a medical student nor at any time after I entered the Specialist Register. 
 Today I went to see one of my male in-patients on the psychiatric ward. He was previously informed that I would be seeing him at a certain time. I was then told that he was busy masturbating. I asked someone to ask him to clean up as I&#x27;ll be there in a few minutes, me thinking he&#x27;d be done by then. Minutes pass. I get to outside his room (door closed). Staff tell me &quot;He&#x27;s still at it.&quot; So I waited about 10 minutes outside of his room. Someone said I should knock and enter. I did not. I spoke with staff outside of his room for the 10 minutes. Then I had to depart for a meeting as I was now running late. He then opened the door to his room as I was about to depart and seemed to want to talk. I couldn&#x27;t as I was going to be late for the important meeting. I thought there was a funny side but off course said nothing of the sort. I breached no standard of practice as far as I am aware. 
 I am unable to reveal other details - and don&#x27;t ask why. I don&#x27;t know how staff knew he was still at it. 
 When one meets an unexpected first, one obviously wonders about what one would do if the situation presented itself again.

                              <span>Seems like a lot of people on this subreddit are very pro-CCT and flee, but was curious if most people expressing these views are ST4+? 
 Currently an ST1 and training&#x27;s been alright - it&#x27;s shielded from a lot of NHS bullshit, but you&#x27;re still working for the NHS. 
 Ophthalmology is switching to a new curriculum next year, but I&#x27;m skeptical this will significantly reduce training length. At the moment, I&#x27;m anticipating to CCT in probably 7-8 years after all of ST and ?fellowship assuming I stay 100% and pass all my exams/expected competencies in a reasonable time frame. 
 I know people have talked about going to Australia or the Middle East, but frankly I&#x27;m not that keen on the latter, and if everyone&#x27;s thinking of going to Australia or Canada after CCT-ing - what is the landscape even going to look like for me when I flee 8 years down the line? üòÖ I do predict there will be healthcare shortages, but I would think locally, they&#x27;d also be looking to expand medical school/training places to accommodate in the next decade too. Is the prospect of CCT and flee as an ST1 even realistic?
 Also, I know ophthalmology is one of the more lucrative specialties, so surely there must be some barriers in place to emigrating vs a specialty that has a more supportive role (e.g. rads, anaes).

                              <span>I&#x27;m an F1, started in a new department a couple weeks ago. There&#x27;s a rule here that we aren&#x27;t allowed to take annual leave when the consultant in our subteam is on-call or post on-call (even if we are just working a normal day on the ward).
 Just wondering if there any rules proving this is a breach of our contract? Quite a few of my annual leave days have been/will be rejected because of this and its making it very difficult to plan time off/holidays to meet my friends :((
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi guys, got a place with Worcester TERS GP training, just wondering if anyone has any insight into the jobs in Worcester (looks to be mainly paeds, T&amp;O, ENT and O&amp;G) and the jobs like psych and palliative med and their GP placements in general. Also wondering what everyone else thinks of the jobs for their preferencing :)

                              <span>Hi, my MSRA rank was 6900, and I haven‚Äôt received a job offer yet. I&#x27;m wondering if all the positions have been filled, or if we should wait for further job offers. Any idea what the rank and score were for the last person who received an offer? It&#x27;s quite overwhelming to prepare for the exam for the third time

                              <span>Question regarding rota - I‚Äôm not a BMA member and my local junior doctor bma rep couldn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm working 8-6 Thursday and Friday, 8-8:30 Saturday, 8-8 Sunday, bank holiday Monday, then 8-6 Tuesday - Friday. Does the bank holiday count as splitting up the shifts and therefore no zero day is needed? I have this on a couple of other occasions (working Thursday through to the following Friday, but without the bank holiday) and after raising this (for a few months), I‚Äôve been given the Monday as a zero day to break up the 9-day stretch. However they are refusing to give a zero day on the week with a bank holiday. They also state because I moved the working weekend I‚Äôm not owed a zero day (I moved the weekend before they agreed to give me any zero days at all, so I‚Äôd argue if I cancel my swap I need my zero day, then reinstate the swap). Note, the working pattern given above is the original rotation (as if the weekend had not been swapped). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.
 Also, do the swaps also have to comply with rotation rules? Because I had no zero day to swap, where I‚Äôve swapped my weekend to is now a 9-day stretch instead.

Have been ok with cannulas but three weeks in and have not managed an intubation successfully because I am either slow (because of fear of intubating the esophagus or damaging the teeth) or actually go down the wrong hole if I rush. Have attempted intubation under supervision like about 8-9 times so surely I should have had some success by now. I am ok with simpler airway things such as masking for pre-oxygenation and can get a good seal.

                              <span>I received a job offer for CT1/2 non training role in one of the hospitals so far away from where I live. The job is excellent and will help me boost my portfolio, and perhaps I could use it to apply for ST3 plastics surgery. 
 I am not able to afford the cost of finding a new place (paying deposit and rent) as well as paying for my current rent as my contract is due to end in June. I have asked if the trust could help with the relocation and they said that unless you are post covers more three years or so, the trust won‚Äôt be able to support you with the relocation.
 I am expected to start as soon as possible and have already signed my contract.
 I asked them if they could advise me on what to do and have only received details of the real estate agents around the area. 
 I have also asked if I could postpone my start date and haven‚Äôt received any response yet
 I am worried that they will withdraw the offer 
 Would appreciate your input/ any suggestions regarding this

It would be so amazing if you could provide just a checklist of shit that I MUST know or else i&#x27;d be booted. I&#x27;m guessing stuff like ABCDE for Emergencies (tbh I have no clue how to even insert a nasal cannula for O2 and how to work a O2 tank fml). What else? 
 NB Baseline: I did extremely shit in Med school (multiple repeat years) but somehow eventually graduated. I am aiming to just not be kicked out of FY-1.

                              <span>Hi everyone I am a paediatric doctor who works in ED quite often. A regular attender 14y old YP with suicidal ideation few week ago called me a P**i behind my back and demanded they want a white doctor when I refused to discharge them without camhs assessment she was told off by the staff members apparently. I actually didn&#x27;t know about this until they represented again and they have an alert I look back at the clinical records documenting clearly they were racially abusive towards me. I didn&#x27;t have to see them this time as one of the other doctors offered to see them. However quite a few times I am the only available senior in the night shift. What are my rights here given the perpetrator is a minor. If they are not in life threatening situation can I refuse to see incase they present again and I am the only person available/ need to senior review?

                              <span>Please can any one explain to me what actually happened to Doctors pay. Other workers in the NHS are put on AFC which places them in bands. Nurses start as Band 5, physician associates start as Band 7 which makes them to currently earn more than FY doctors and some CT doctors. 
 I learnt that doctors chose not to be part of the AFC and chose a different pay structure. This made FY doctors&#x27; salary to be actually at Band 5 level where as If doctors were part of AFC they would have been placed to start atleast as Band 8A. So why are starting with a band 5 salary? 
 Is it better to go back to the AFC like other staff? Is the different pay structure wee are using now going to benefit us anytime soon? ( would things fall back in place soon) 
 I am actually confused.

I have tried getting information on groups, and I was disheartened to see Durham doesn&#x27;t have a good reputation. Is anyone working in acute/gastro in Durham? What are your opinions? I am planning to commute from Newcastle.
 Any accommodation advice that works for both hospitals for a single doctor? Where do doctors usually live in Newcastle? I would really appreciate your input.
 Thank you.

Since being appointed as surgical SpR, I‚Äôve repeated a year for ‚Äúinadequate progress‚Äù after 6 months of bullying from a senior. My new boss is no better. All I do is read for work and study only to get comments highlighting what I don‚Äôt know after questioning. At ARCP they bring up the fact you‚Äôre not operating when consultants refuse to let you do anything. My friends in the private sector laugh at me for staying. The contract sucks. The way our colleagues are treated sucks. What‚Äôs the point any more?

                              <span>I recently pivoted and decided to apply for a competitive specialty which I hadn&#x27;t previously planned for. Luckily, I completed a QIP in this specialty previously but the consultant in-charge is hands-off and slow to reply. 
 Long story short, abstract submissions for the last conference I can find that would allow me to present this QIP prior to specialty applications closes soon. I have tried contacting the consultant and other senior involved many times to ask if they are happy for me to submit an abstract, but they are taking their time to reply (which isn&#x27;t unusual for them). It&#x27;s my fault because I&#x27;m scrambling to build my portfolio last minute.
 Presuming the consultant doesn&#x27;t reply to me in time, is it appropriate for me to submit the abstract at the last moment without their permission? 
 I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m over thinking it, but this is likely my last and only opportunity to present this QIP to make it count for specialty applications.
 Thank you so much in advance for your advice!!

 Does the trust give you a new email/update your payslips etc automatically or is it a ballache to change over

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m 41/m.
 I&#x27;ve attended a private clinic today for a consultation, which was initially for an umbilicoplasty, but the surgeon diagnosed it as an umbilical hernia. He&#x27;s told me it&#x27;s not particularly serious in itself, but there is a risk of complications developing in the future.
 The quote from the private clinic is ¬£5000. I have already ¬£1600 saved which was the quoted price of the umbilicoplasty, so to go ahead with this treatment would require me to find ¬£3400 from somewhere.
 My employer doesn&#x27;t currently provide private health insurance, so if I took out a policy myself, I don&#x27;t know if this would cover it.
 I have searched for information regarding treating this on the NHS, but from what I can see unless there are actual symptons, this isn&#x27;t available - can anyone advise?
 Thanks

                              <span>Very quick question. I‚Äôve got Hashimoto‚Äôs disease and been under endocrine for 2 years. I was taken off Levo early on being under the team. Discharged in Jan being told my thyroid is fine. I‚Äôm declining fast so out of curiosity asked for all my results from 2022 onwards. Had them sent to me noticed only my TSH was reported. 
 I went to my GP to ask for my thyroid panel to be done and she also cannot see any bloods for T4, T3 etc. Only TSH. She was really confused. 
 I‚Äôve been fuming thinking this hasn‚Äôt been requested in two years but found a photo of two blood forms I had for 2023 all requesting full thyroid panel. In one of the matching dates to results even my TSH is missing‚Ä¶
 Can labs just not be done?

It has been eleven days since submitting this and I still haven&#x27;t had my ID confirmed? 
 I&#x27;m just curious if anyone else has had to wait for such a long time? On the official website it suggests that the ID would be checked within a few hours, which seems alarming as I hadn&#x27;t been provided with that information upon application.
 Many thanks,

                              <span>When it comes to lack of capacity (mental capacity act), information on this is in the area of mental illness very vague.
 I fully understand what lack of capacity is and common conditions involve brain injury, learning disabilities, dementia etc. I understand it involves a persons ability to make decisions, remember information long enough to make a decision, communicate their decision, and so on.
 But I‚Äôm specifically asking about mental health conditions and when and how they affect a persons capacity.
 I can‚Äôt seem to find any information online, except Schizophrenia and Bipolar commonly can affect a persons capacity.
 Can someone explain how certain mental health conditions can affect a persons capacity and deem them as having lack of capacity, not just conditions mentioned above.
 For example, I understand that when someone suffering severe Anorexia is at severe risk of harm they can be deemed as lacking mental capacity.
 But when does lack of mental health capacity apply to other mental illnesses, and what factors determine this? Like can someone suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder be such a risk that they would be deemed as lacking mental capacity, and if so, what behaviours would lead to this decision?

                              <span>I have a question regarding adult safeguarding.
 I am due to start my first job in Adult mental health (complex mental health issues) and I am fully aware of safeguarding procedures and protocols (infact, it‚Äôs something I take seriously as I suffered abuse growing up). I know any concerns about possible abuse have to be documented in full detail, as soon as possible, but one thing that is never mentioned or clearly defined is whether to openly ask a patient about regular bruising and injuries, or whether you just document your concerns after a session. 
 I am asking because I know someone who was in a domestic violence situation a few years ago and also at the time attending psychology therapy. She isn‚Äôt in that abusive situation anymore but at the time she was spoken to by (I think) adult‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Hello I&#x27;d like to climb the ladder after 3 years in my current role but I&#x27;m not sure where the ladder is or even if there is one.
 I&#x27;ve explored doing the foundation degree in mental health, with a view towards Occupational Therapy eventually, but it seems my trust are not willing or able to fund it. It also takes me away from the lived experience aspect of my current role which is important to me and one of my main skills. But roles higher than a b3 in Peer Support/lived experience are hard to find too. 
 Does anyone have any advice at all?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a ward clerk that&#x27;s looking to join a union; not for any pressing matter, just given the political climate in the UK. The big 3 that get mentioned are Unison, Unite and GMB but the thing that&#x27;s making me hesitate about them is that Unison &amp; Unite seem to list every other hospital profession under the sun specificaly as staff they cater to but ward clerks are lumped into the &#x27;and other admin staff&#x27; category; and GMB seems to be workers in general with no specialisation. On one hand I get it, ward clerks are comparatively low in numbers compared to most other hospital roles, but on the other hand I want to know that a union will be looking out for us just as much as they do for the roles with big numbers.
 Open to any advice on which union might be best for ward clerks and if there&#x27;s any other unions to suggest please do.

I wanted input about what diagnosis is lacking data for our MVP of this product. Currently we are throwing around geriatrics, pregnancy, mental health, and chronic diseases. I would love the medical communities opinion on what would gain the most traction with customers for a medical API that provides medical standards.

                              <span>Recently I was in a diagnostic session with the consultant psychiatrist in my local NHS recovery team. My GP referred me to them for a PTSD diagnosis, CPA, talking therapies, and medication advice.
 I was taken aback during the latest session when the psychiatrist began really pushing me to look at going privately for talking therapies.
 I get that the NHS is crumbling - I work in the same NHS Trust - but it felt really wrong to me that an NHS professional should advocate for going against the founding principles of the NHS.
 Does anyone else feel that this is unethical?
 ‚Äî
 Extra information: I have the distinct impression that the recovery service really doesn‚Äôt want to take me on because I need significant reasonable adjustments to their usual ways of working. My autism and ADHD impact my presentation of mental health symptoms, and I need lots of additional time to process emotions and information. The local IAPT straight up rejected me as ‚Äòtoo complex,‚Äô and told my GP to send me to recovery. But it feels that rather than adapt and adjust, recovery want to find any reason to reject me too.

                              <span>Most doctors work hand in hand with drug companies, so prefer to issue prescriptions. There seems to be a culture where by medical professionals are not allowed to express evidence led views which go against drug companies. 
 Example 1: 
 Bunion Repair
 Bunion repair by Bianchi, Italy or Harley Street &#x3D; No screw, 5 minute procedure, brilliant. No pharma company involved.
 Whilst Bianchi is a superior reoair, standard NHS bunion repair &#x3D; Invasive procedure using a purchased medical device (screw).
 Example 2:
 Inguinal hernia repair
 Desarda technique &#x3D; A strip of external oblique is stitched to inguinal ligaments and internal oblique. Wonderful natural muscle graft. 
 Whilst desarda is superior, NHS repair &#x3D; A piece of purchased polypropylene stitched into your abdominal wall. YUCK
 Example 3
 Heart stents &#x3D; Research shows that the vast majority of operations brought no benefit in stable patients. But the surgeries were arguable performed due to the stents being a medical product was being pushed and purchased. 
 Example 4
 Fasting. 
 The health benefits are endless. Reverse insulin resistance, autophagy etc etc
 Fasting doesn‚Äôt involve any prescriptions, so doesn‚Äôt seem to be recommended.
 How many GP‚Äôs/consultants prescribe a 10 day fast?
 
 I can go private and see doctors with views that differ from the masses. But are there NHS doctors out there that are able to have less than conventional views without being scalded.

                              <span>Hello all!
 Longtime lurker posting on a throwaway. 
 I&#x27;m an SHO grade doc working in Scotland just now. I was looking at ways to bolster my income and fell onto ear syringing. I have good experience in performing it, albeit not having attended any formal courses, and feel it&#x27;s relatively low risk as I intent to take a good history and ensure I&#x27;m not suctioning at a steatoma with my otoscope. A local dental practice I&#x27;m on good terms with (not my own dentist) have offered a chair a day a week to run a mini clinic. 
 Has anyone got experience in this market? I&#x27;ve been having difficulty finding any real info on indemnity around this. Most of the indemnity products I&#x27;ve found are aimed at companies/clinics with multiple practitioners. Further, does anyone know the situation with making the clinic compliant? I&#x27;ve read about needing CQC approval down south, but again, can&#x27;t find any info on Scotland. 
 Any input is welcome!

                              <span>I‚Äôm currently a CT1 in surgery and I‚Äôm four years into medicine. I‚Äôve done nights regularly for three of the four years. I‚Äôm still disablingly scared of them, even if I‚Äôm actually OK on the actual stretch. My current job has quite a few nights but workload is generally okay, so my anxiety is not bad but it‚Äôs certainly problematic. I find myself trawling the ED track board for hours before my shift predicting who I might have to see or not. Advice is never too far away but I am so scared of appearing shit that I prepare and over prepare. There really is no point trying to predict referrals as I know what to do with most of them anyway, but it‚Äôs a compulsion I can‚Äôt stop. 
 My next rotation will be in a speciality I have little knowledge on, but I will be covering wards AND referrals overnight. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to perpetually be a wreck. I sometimes get fleeting thoughts of calling in sick so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it - I never, ever do, but it‚Äôs so tempting sometimes that I‚Äôm ashamed to say that sometimes the thought lingers a bit too long in my head. 
 It doesn‚Äôt help that my sleep is almost universally shit on them, and my eating isn‚Äôt much better. 
 Grateful for any help/tips/reassurance that this can pass, and I can trust myself a bit more.

                              <span>Thought I‚Äôd ask the hive mind! I‚Äôm applying for anaesthetic core training next year and would ideally like to be placed in either Oxford or Wales deanery. That said, I really want the Oxford University Hospitals rotation. I am just wondering how it all works. Am I able to apply to both and see which rotation I get before accepting my offer? Or is it deaneries first and then you choose your rotation and get allocated according to rank like the FY programme? I would take virtually anywhere in Wales tbh but if I knew for sure I‚Äôd been allocated OUH‚Äôs rotation in Thames Valley, I‚Äôd take that instead. Appreciate that this is all hypothetical and at the end of the day I‚Äôd take any post I get regardless but just wondering how it works. Thanks

                              <span>Yet another incoming FY1 here. Basically I have a 2 year gap between graduating and starting F1 in which I did nothing medicine-related. I feel like I&#x27;ve forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn&#x27;t that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don&#x27;t remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.
 Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO&#x27;s (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I&#x27;ve been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I&#x27;ve also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I&#x27;ve contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? 
 Just for a little more info: I‚Äôm starting on gen surg. Also I&#x27;m hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I&#x27;m honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I&#x27;m working a 9-5 office job which I&#x27;m looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. 
 Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I&#x27;m ready to put my best foot forward and I‚Äôm honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound. Thank you so muchüôè

                              <span>Hi everyone, incoming fy1 here interested in physics, maths and engineering related specialties. What sort of pathway could I go down to explore these topics more in medicine? I understand radiology has a decent amount of physics and there‚Äôs certain specialties like nuclear medicine to consider, both of which interest me a lot. I am just wondering what other things I could be doing alongside going into these specialties that could get me into a field that has a decent balance of medicine and physics/engineering. I have considered PhD programs to do with biomedical engineering that might lend to a more academic career, or ones that I could do alongside my radiology training, would like to know more about this.
 Would love to know if anyone here has gone down such a route or if anyone knows anything about it. Thank you.

                              <span>People ask me what I want to specialize in and I say Histopath with rads in close second and the first question they have is about AI and that diagnostic rads and histopath may become obsolete with AI. From what I have seen so far from tasters in both specialties, AI is nowhere near even replacing doctors in rads or path and the clinical context is super important when producing reports of either CT scans or reporting microscopic slides which I don‚Äôt see AI deal with the nuances of anytime soon. I get asked this question so much that I feel it probably may even end up being an interview question when I make my application. But at the same time because I get asked this question a lot (by other doctors), perhaps there is some truth to it?
 What do the radiologists and pathologists here have to say about this? Interested in hearing your thoughts.

                              <span>For context, I am not a consultant/GP, have been qualified and working as a doctor for 7 years. Will be keeping this vague for identifiability purposes.
 A friend of mine runs a food and drink business. They&#x27;re expanding to several other countries after some success in the UK, including the USA, Europe, and Asia.
 One of the regulatory bodies has different allergen standards (I.e. acceptable concentrations), which has highlighted some issues and changes they&#x27;ll have to make to sell some of their food there.
 They&#x27;re looking for a doctor to essentially take the info regarding some of these issues, collate some evidence around them, and sort of explain it all to the board of their company, and attempt to quantify some risks for them. Not to necessarily say &quot;this is medically fine&quot; or &quot;go full steam ahead with production&quot;, but more to explain some of the issues from a medical standpoint and the repercussions should something go wrong.
 Any risk would theoretically be covered by their indemnity and lawyers, and a document would be prepared stating that they&#x27;ve consulted a doctor for advice but that the company is entirely responsible and culpable for their own decisions
 My questions boil down to is this an acceptable thing to do? 
 I&#x27;m not an expert in any regard, and I&#x27;m still a junior doctor. They&#x27;re asking because we are friends is all.
 Is there anyone out there who&#x27;s done something similar for a company/in a commercial setting? Would it be bonkers to consider doing this (essentially it boils down to a literature review turned to lay language)? Would an indemnity provider like MDU have specialised cover for this sort of thing or?

                              <span>Hi everyone I am using a throwaway account as I do not want to be identified I am an incoming f1, rounding up the final bits of med school, elective on the way 
 I have been in a long term relationship throughout med school with my partner who I am now culturally/ traditionally married to. We just haven‚Äôt done a religious / white wedding yet . We were planning on doing this April 2025
 I have just found out I am pregnant. This was not planned and is coming as a total shock/surprise . Yes we did use contraception but as I have learnt these can also fail My husband is very supportive and I know he will be a great dad
 I am just very anxious about it all. I am wondering if starting f1 whilst pregnant is a good idea . I am a graduate student so having a baby was definitely a plan in the near future . Initially taking a year out after F1 or F2
 I am also worried on the financial strain this will put on my husband as by the time I am due I will not be entitled to the nhs maternity pay 
 I am just wondering if I should just postpone f1 to next year altogether? My due date at the moment is late December/ early Jan so I could technically finish the first rotation 
 Fy1 is already hard enough and I‚Äôm just worried I will not be able to cope.

                              <span>With everything going around the media and forums I‚Äôm at a crossroads - nearly finished training and getting on a bit age wise. 
 Probably going to complete training and leave the profession because I‚Äôve realised that nothing will ever change no matter how hard I work and whatever I do to try to make the system better will just cause push back on me - so there‚Äôs no point. Have learnt this the hard way every year so far as a doctor - nobody wants improvement they only want to perpetuate the status quo and crush any challenge to authority or even open discussion. 
 The NHS can have its way and just employ under qualified robots to do it‚Äôs willing as per the way of the world these days. Maybe outsource healthcare to a call centre in India? Robot consultations as is the way in the USA. 
 Anyway - does anyone actually know a tradesperson earning ¬£50-60k/y? I‚Äôd rather cut my losses and go back to college despite having postgrad degrees on top of medical training. 
 Has anyone successfully started a business like aesthetics or even non medical and made it succeed? 
 Is there any hope at all for the profession because I‚Äôm not hearing anything positive at all and it feels very much like the government don‚Äôt want or need doctors and in the UK the government IS the NHS. And the overseas market for UK doctors is saturated. 
 Do any senior doctors actually want to change the system? And do they understand what your junior ‚Äòcolleagues‚Äô are going through (ie not just robots to do what you tell them but also thinking and intelligent humans wish to contribute)?

 Have been thinking about future career prospects and having done further reading, ophthalmology seems interesting.

 Would appreciate any help/advice that you guys can offer!

 Should I be feeling this insecure so close to the end? 
 Still find myself making silly mistakes, nothing untoward happening to the patients but still dumb mistakes/oversights that I catch later and spend the day ruminating about. 
 I get good feedback from juniors and consultants but I don‚Äôt think they tend to notice what I‚Äôm up to being a senior trainee.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the pleasure at working at many different hospitals. Which means I&#x27;ve worked with many different blood transfusion labs and feel that their approach to group and save samples is incredibly hard-line. 
 At this point, I&#x27;d like to point out I am very aware of what I&#x27;m asking for when I request a blood transfusion and I do have a genuine appreciation for the risks involved and for the potential for catastrophic mishaps.
 However, I&#x27;ve seen multiple occasions where samples have been rejected (often at the disservice of the patient) for extremely rigid rules that are completely inflexible. This leads to repeated stabs which are unpleasant for the patient or, at its worst, a delay in transfusion of cross matched blood. 
 What are your feelings on the threshold for rejecting G&amp;S samples?

                              <span>Offered a job in a hospital which has a lot of PA‚Äôs, reading the BMA advice ahead of time. In the BMA MAP scope, it says teaching is not to happen unless it falls within the safe parameters of working for MAPS. Does this mean things both within the green and orange boxes?
 For example, in psych, the green for MAPS is physical healthcare related only. So does this mean PA can teach related to performing a physical exam, but shouldn‚Äôt be teaching things like MSE/History taking? 
 Likewise, O&amp;G, orange box is refit or replace vaginal pessaries. Can they be teaching doctors how to do so?
 Has anyone been asked to arrange teaching programmes involving PA as educators and if so how have you organised this so it‚Äôs appropriate?

                              <span>Are there any enterprising prompt engineers on this sub? I‚Äôm trying to create a prompt that will reliably get ChatGPT to spit out somewhat reasonable reflections to pad out my portfolio with. The best I‚Äôve managed to come up with is:
 ‚ÄúYou are a medical doctor writing a reflective piece to include in your logbook. The case that you are reflecting on is [insert scenario] and the learning points that you want to take away are [insert learning points]. The reflective piece should be between 500-1000 words and should be based on the Gibbs reflective cycle. Keep a professional tone but inject some evidence of empathy throughout the text‚Äù 
 I‚Äôve been getting middling results with this and was wondering if anyone has any pointers on how to improve the prompt? 
 Edit: totally on board with the responses about 500-1000 words being way too long. My initial plan was to just pad it with so much stuff nobody would bother reading it to be honest!

                              <span>I was assigned a community placement in psychiatry for my GP training. When I tried to get a fob to access the car park, I was told that because I&#x27;m only there for 4 months, I&#x27;m not eligible for a fob. When I asked the admin team where I was supposed to park, they told me to park on the roads nearby. The placement is in quite a deprived area, and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable parking on the roads a few minutes walk away. So I parked in the patients&#x27; car park a few times, and was issued a ¬£100 fine.
 I ended up telling the consultant that I&#x27;m under about the whole situation, and he was very indignant about it. Sent an email to the admin team straightaway and I got a car park fob the next day. In hindsight, should have told the consultant about it a lot sooner.
 Just really nice to have your consultant stick up for you!

 My current job has a 3 month notice period. I was just wondering, would I be put at a disadvantage if I were to apply for Medical Lab assistant role with a 3 month notice period? For example, someone might be able to start sooner. Is that taken into consideration? Of course this is assuming I did well in the application/interview and ticked all the boxes etc.
 I&#x27;m wondering whether to just hand in my notice period and start applying

 So about two months ago I contacted the cqc about the hospital i work in. They did a suprise visit about two months later ward is under threat of closure. The annoying thing that is despite this the same issues are still going on, when the cqc do a suprise visit do they have to give reasons as to why? and what prompts them to do suprise visits

                              <span>I‚Äôve been given two separate blood forms from two consultants, requesting for different things to be tested (one is some baseline stuff, the other is just for iron/ferritin).
 What happens if I take two blood forms into the blood centre? Will I need two vials of blood taken, or can the blood forms be ‚Äúcombined‚Äù somehow so everything is tested in one go?
 Sorry if this is a stupid question. I have a lot of anxiety around blood tests and it helps me a lot to know what to expect!

                              <span>Hi guys, I‚Äôm waiting for hemithyroidectomy since 12th Jan, I‚Äôve been told by ENT doctor that it‚Äôs been put down as urgent (suspected cancer, biopsies were inconclusive, I have trouble breathing, swallowing etc.) and waiting time is up to 12 weeks. Well, it‚Äôs already been 12 weeks, I‚Äôve got a ‚Äúfollow up‚Äù appointment booked for 3rd May, I‚Äôve called them up and I‚Äôve been told I haven‚Äôt been put down for any procedure in the system :) I‚Äôve called them once before mid March and everything was fine, they just told me that I don‚Äôt have a date for the op yet and that‚Äôs it and now that. Does anyone know where can I complain or what can I do so they‚Äôll actually get it together? It‚Äôs been months of stress and anxiety. Thanks in advance x

                              <span>Every time I am in the NHS system, at some point you are put into a holding pen of sorts at one stage. That is absolutely fine and I appreciate the NHS.
 However the simplest service step of just saying, &#x27;the wait will be about 30 minutes, you need to wait for the doctor&#x27;, or even &#x27;the wait could be 4 hours because we only have 1 ### but you need to be here in case we get you in earlier&#x27;. 
 People just want to know something, so they can relax. But you&#x27;re forced to awkwardly approach staff milling about and ask, which makes you look impatient. When you just want some idea of what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>Hi so I‚Äôm graduating from my Bsc in biomedical science this year, and I‚Äôve applied to the STP for clinical neurophysiology. I was wondering what are my options to continue a career in neuroscience and get lab accredited if I don‚Äôt happen to get into the STP? I understand there‚Äôs always other masters courses without the clinical training aspect but I really want a career in the NHS and to work in healthcare. Also just fyi my Bsc is not an IBMS accredited degree so I don‚Äôt have any certification to work in a lab once I graduate. I feel like the STP is my best chance at kickstarting my career so I need to have a backup if it doesn‚Äôt work out this year. Please help!

 Please help us understand your views and experiences in relation to the role of Physician Associates (PAs) in general practice settings by completing our survey by Fri 10th May.
 The survey has been developed by the RCGP, following direction from RCGP Council, but is being conducted independently by Research by Design, an independent research agency.
 Your response will help us to understand more about how PAs are currently working in general practice as well as GP views on the benefits and challenges associated with this. We are also seeking your input on what framework and parameters should be in place to ensure that PAs working in general practice can do so safely and effectively, and what guidance is needed from RCGP.
 I know you&#x27;re all really busy, but the survey should only take 20‚Äì25 minutes to complete, and is really important, so please do take part if you can. We are keen to hear from as many members as possible to ensure we can gain a good understanding of views across the UK.

                              <span>Hello! My question is as above. We are an IMG couple and is my husband is applying to FY2 Standalone Program which will start this August 2024. I plan to apply for the 2nd round of GP training which will open on July and will start Feb. 2025. 
 Is it feasible that we both do this if we have a 5 year old child? And we will all be moving to the UK mid-July before FY2 starts. 
 I‚Äôm concerned regarding our schedule and it its feasible to manage being hands-on with our son or if it would be very busy and if its advisable I apply to GP training once my husband is done with FY2. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all. 
 A benign mass was found in my breast a few months ago but I‚Äôm really nervous as I feel like I‚Äôm being pushed toward surgery. 
 I‚Äôve had appointments set for days I‚Äôve informed the staff I can‚Äôt make, appointment times moved without consultation, and they want to make a 5cm incision on my breast (either around my nipple or near my armpit) but won‚Äôt tell me where they‚Äôre going to cut into me until after I‚Äôm under (I‚Äôm not a very big person that will be a significant portion of my breast). There‚Äôs been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I‚Äôve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn‚Äôt use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I‚Äôm really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the ‚Äúusual surgery risks‚Äù (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). 
 I‚Äôve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don‚Äôt have have savings as they‚Äôve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can‚Äôt tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement. I‚Äôm incredibly anxious about this whole thing as I don‚Äôt really have a support network outside of my care team. If anyone could share their own experiences with breast clinics in the UK I would appreciate it.

                              <span>I (30sF) had a relationship for over 10 years with my ex (30sM) broke up 3 years ago.
 It ended badly. He took my home and my possessions. Cheated, was abusive. He sexually assaulted me. I didn&#x27;t report it, so no official complaint is logged.
 He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.
 Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.
 I soon moved because I didn&#x27;t want to be anywhere near him.
 He&#x27;s contacted friends asking where I am.
 My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex&#x27;s part of the hospital. My relative&#x27;s mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.
 My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn&#x27;t understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.
 My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he&#x27;d be far enough away and chances low.
 Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.
 More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.
 My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.
 I don&#x27;t know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.
 Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen? Could this help stop him continuing to contact my family using the hospital?
 Any help is much appreciated.

                              <span>Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks&#x27; time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.
 Near the top of the letter is a phone number to &#x27;reschedule or cancel&#x27;. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to &#x27;reschedule or cancel&#x27;, it seems reasonable that if I don&#x27;t contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there&#x27;s a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.
 I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do, so I figured I&#x27;d ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven&#x27;t been able to get through to anyone.
 So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I&#x27;m unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?
 I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I&#x27;ve been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I&#x27;m terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.
 Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).
 Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.

                              <span>I am an undergraduate psychology student who has an interview for a placement in the NHS. I am curious about the benefits of taking this placement as it is unpaid, and I am concerned whether the advantages (such as potentially securing a job more easily after university) outweigh the costs (such as increased university debt).
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all, for a few years I&#x27;ve been having recurring abdominal pain, which seems to be chronic gastritis as I have all the symptoms.
 I first brought this up to my GP in 2022, which resulted in me taking prescribed omeprazole for 3 months. After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what&#x27;s causing my stomach pain.
 Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were &quot;inconclusive.&quot; I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.
 This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.
 This has been going on for years and I&#x27;m frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements. What can I do???

I&#x27;ve been at my current doctors for 5 years &amp; they&#x27;re aware of my medical history. It says medical Condition 0. 
 I asked my doctors &amp; they asked me to put it in writing which I did. Does anyone know how long it will take to get my full medical history from birth if possible? Because I was really sick as a child. My mum told me had different medical issues which I later found out I didn&#x27;t. thank you.
 Thank you to everyone. I have my medical records now. 163 pages.

                              <span>I‚Äôve recently been told that I have to transfer in to a new team after my training year (I don‚Äôt want to say the role incase I reveal myself).
 My first day of being in this team I was told by my line manager that they didn‚Äôt really see a place for me and that they‚Äôd help me create a CV for another job. 
 Am I wrong in being upset about this?

 It seems GP across the country is in a dire situation, but I have been told it is &quot;better&quot; in London. 
 For fully qualified GP&#x27;s who are and have been working in London...
 How is it? 
 Is it sustainable? 
 Are there more &quot;opportunities&quot;, private or otherwise? 
 Do you get paid (alot) more in London? 
 Are there more partnership opportunities? How about getting into other industries such as branching into health tech / pharma? 
 Or perhaps going into more public health / regulation / policy? 
 For those outside of London, is it as bad as the press says it is? GPs going to food banks, or going to 
 I think the recent issues in GP have been making me strongly consider whether to remain in training or leave to enter a different speciality. 
 I figured getting some objective truth / advice from fellow GPs on here would be helpful.

                              <span>Hi all am a bit stuck with delays getting onto the performers list and having a nightmare with PCSE, would appreciate some advice about how I can try and get it sorted asap. I‚Äôm UK trained and CCT‚Äôd in Feb 2024. I hadn‚Äôt been told re: being on the PL as a registrar so tried to apply as qualified since mid January. Initially PCSE website was down so couldn‚Äôt do it, then my account got frozen and unusable, it took 6 weeks of emails and phone calls for them to sort. I finally got application put through and have been waiting another few weeks since. All this while, I managed to get a job on OOH bank contract but am being told I‚Äôm not allowed to take any work with them until on PL. I‚Äôm also concerned if this drags on further they‚Äôll terminate my contract. I engaged BMA before but hasn‚Äôt seemed to help. I‚Äôm now almost 3 months post CCT and it‚Äôs causing me loss of income- I‚Äôve drawn on savings for mortgage etc but the whole thing has impacted my finances and I‚Äôm pretty angry. Any help/advice much appreciated sorry if this comes across as ranty!

                              <span>Hi all, i am a gp ( recent cct). I love to travel , it‚Äôs something I truly enjoy doing. I am currently in Japan and have been here for the past 3 months, absolutely love the people and the culture, and planning to travel for least 12 months. I don‚Äôt want to keep coming back to uk and locuming for a couple of weeks and heading out again. Then it hit me , why not work remotely using a VPN . There must be way right, I mean we are living in 2024 not 1980, the world is so connected now. I heard that indemnity can be a headache ? I don‚Äôt understand why tho. What‚Äôs the difference between speaking to a patient in Japan as opposed to in my living room , if makes no sense to me. Has anyone done this ? Would really like to hear your thoughts. Thanks all üôè

                              <span>TW for mention of death. 
 I apologise for asking such a blunt question, but I‚Äôve always wondered about this and wondered if anyone can inform me. 
 I always think about the paramedic who informed me that my Mum had passed away, many years ago. She died in a very upsetting and traumatic way, and from what I understand, the visual would have been really upsetting. I did not see her. 
 I always think of him and I wonder what kind of support he would have been given. Is there an official process? Is there mandatory counselling given after incidents like this? 
 Thank you in advance, and apologies for the morbid question.

                              <span>I have a medical exemption card. When I went to get a prescription earlier, they said ‚Äòand you have a pre-paid certificate right?‚Äô And I said ‚Äòno I have a medical exemption‚Äô and they looked puzzled and said they have me down as pre-paid certificate. I showed my card, they then entered the correct type and all was fine. 
 What has now worried me is I‚Äôve collected prescriptions a couple of times from here previously, one last week and one in January. I‚Äôm pretty sure I showed my card then or said I had a medical exemption. Any chance they wrote down the wrong type at one point and now that‚Äôs stored on my file? Could I get penalised by the NHS BSA if it looks like l‚Äôve claimed on this when I haven‚Äôt? Maybe they‚Äôd see if I have a medical exemption and it‚Äôd be ok, but not sure how their checking system works. 
 I will go into the pharmacy tomorrow just to check with them, but thought I‚Äôd ask on here as it‚Äôs causing a little anxiety. Thank you

                              <span>Hi all
 Accepted on upcoming Aug entry to GPST. I already have my locality.
 I&#x27;m looking to get a mortgage. The broker says they need a contract prior to AIP/offer. Does anyone have past experience with when we would receive an offer (I&#x27;d imagine it might be very late) or any other advice regarding this.
 I would imagine even the specialist brokers for doctors would require a contract.
 Thank you

I was at a point where I questioning my decision to be in GP training. Thanks to the weekly teaching group sessions at the time, I could understand that experience can vary greatly between practices and therefore decided it would be sensible to stay on to see how things go in my next primary care rotation.

                              <span>Everyone here will have worked in a hospital rotation of some sort. How many times do you hear the patient say ‚Äúoh I went to my GP who told me to come in‚Äù. Everyone rolls their eyes at the silly GP sending people in because they‚Äôre lazy
 When you speak to the patient, a good proportion won‚Äôt have actually seen a doctor: - Some of them went to their practice nurse for a routine checkup - Some of them went to one of the PA or ACPs - Some of them called up their GP and couldn‚Äôt get past the ‚Äúgo to A&amp;E if you think it‚Äôs an emergency‚Äù
 Anyone else noticed this/got any thoughts? You never actually went to your GP, but it all gets lumped together as ‚Äúwhy has their GP sent them in for THAT?!?!l 
 (Obviously goes without saying that shit and/or GPs exist, and everyone‚Äôs guilty of an embarrassing referral)

                              <span>Hi all. Wanted to get thoughts from people.
 I&#x27;m entering GP training in August. I really wanted an A&amp;E rotation as I want to work in A&amp;E occasionally as a GP. I&#x27;m interested in managing minor injuries, suturing, procedures etc. I know a lot of this is done by non doctors but I wanted to build up experience so I can do a lot of OOH work as a GP. However, I didn&#x27;t get my chosen ED rotation as there were only 3 to choose from...
 Does this limit my ability once I&#x27;m qualified if I wanted to spend a decent amount of time in ED as a GP?

                              <span>Hi I am not sure if I understood everything completely, that&#x27;s why I am writing this post. I hope someone correct me if I am wrong. I have seen that the fill rate for GP training for the previous years was always less than 100%. Does that mean that there are always unoccupied posts? If this is true, it means that an applicant can get an offer even if his MSRA score is very low

                              <span>GP Practice- Stockport
 I‚Äôve accepted my GP offer at Stepping Hill and have been asked to rank GP practices in Stockport. 
 Does anyone have any experience of working at these GP practices? If so, which ones would you rank top 5 and which ones to avoid and why?
 Thank you in advance :)

                              <span>I am a GPST1, relatively de-skilled re asthma management and COPD as we have respiratory nurses that do the most of it. 
 ‚Äã
 I got confused re-dosages, escalation policy and when to use what 
 Nice/BTS/GINA State different things and dosages : so my questions are 
 ‚Äã
 -Any simplified escalation policy including dosages involved? 
 -Maximal dose of steroid per day (GINA states 2000, BTS/NICE 1000) 
 -Maximal dose of LABA. It&#x27;s officially 46 for Formoterol, but saw patients using more. 
 -What do you give if patient is on Fostair and reached 8 puffs a day (&#x3D;maximal dose of Formoterol 46mcg) and you wish to increase his inhaled steroids 
 -role of muntelukast in this story 
 -role of anti histamins (as resp nurses gives it at times as well) 
 -would you give combined LABA+Steroid(e.g. fostair) and also reliever therapy as salbutamol of not well controlled on maximal dose?
 ‚Äã
 Your help is IMMENSLY appreciated!

                              <span>I know this question has been asked a few times before, but what‚Äôs the best courses I can attend as a GPST? My current region is quite generous with their allocation so I‚Äôm hoping to make the most of the budget. I‚Äôve done PCDS dermoscopy which was very useful and enjoyable.
 Also if there‚Äôs any that are not only useful but also CV boosters that would help too!

                              <span>A new oral vaccine for cholera has received prequalification by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 April. The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. 
‚ÄúThe new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,‚Äù said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. ‚ÄúThe new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.‚Äù
WHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S. ¬†
Vaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.¬† 
There were 473¬†000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</span>

                              <span>Hear me out. My practice PC can barely run more than S1/AccuRx and a few chrome tabs (or one NHS Mail tab). If I try to open a PDF it&#x27;s russian roulette whether or not my screen will hang, and don&#x27;t even get me started on the arachaic Word referral doc system we still have going because that&#x27;s another rant in itself...
 I looked at &quot;My Computer&quot; the other day and saw that the PC I use has 8GB RAM. My iPhone has 6GB of RAM and all I use that for is reddit and ignoring my emails, but I digress.
 I found this the other day. An 8GB RAM upgrade for the PC I&#x27;m using. This would double my RAM, quadrouple my productivity and probably cure the viral URTI of the patient sitting in front of me if it tried hard enough - and all for the low, low price of ¬£16.94.
 So tell me, someone, anyone, please, why shouldn&#x27;t I just purchase this and install it onto my practice PC? It would cost me less than a nice take-out dinner and serve me righteously for years to come!
 (PS: Do you think I would have to run this by the IT guy or do you think it&#x27;s cool if I just open &#x27;er up and giv&#x27;r? Srs answers only plz.)

                              <span>Hello GPs and supervisors, 
 I am currently GPST2 who is starting a placement at a UTC where there‚Äôs basically no GPs and obviously no GP trainers. It‚Äôs completely run by allied health care professionals. There‚Äôs a GP on-call remotely for advice and that‚Äôs all. 
 My question is: am I ok with working with no supervision? As per my understanding and the NHSE policy; GP trainees are to be supervised at all times when in GP practice. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same with UTCs. 
 Advice and course of action appreciated.

All around the world, the core challenges consistently compromising the right to health are political inaction coupled with a lack of accountability and funding, compounded by intolerance, discrimination and stigma.

Countries that will receive kits in the coming weeks in this largest-ever global deployment include those currently severely impacted by cholera outbreaks, such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Syria, and Zambia. This programme will improve the timeliness and accuracy of outbreak detection and response by boosting routine surveillance and testing capacity and helping rapidly identify probable cholera cases. Critically, it will also help countries monitor trends and build an evidence base for future preventive programmes, supporting the achievement of national cholera control and elimination targets.</span>

                              <span>User researcher Fern Williams describes how we created a new paper patient registration form to complement the online ‚ÄòRegister with a GP surgery‚Äô service, allowing everyone to have a consistent user experience and leaving no one digitally excluded.

Though there is a shift towards digital to make registering with a GP surgery easier and more convenient for both patients and practice staff, we haven‚Äôt forgotten the importance of developing a paper registration form for those who prefer not to or can‚Äôt use a digital service.</span>

                              <span>WHO has launched a new network for coronaviruses, CoViNet, to facilitate and coordinate global expertise and capacities for early and accurate detection, monitoring and assessment of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and novel coronaviruses of public health importance. 
CoViNet expands on the WHO COVID-19 reference laboratory network established during the early days of the pandemic.¬† Initially, the lab network was focused on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but will now address a broader range of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and potential new coronaviruses. CoViNet is a network of global laboratories with expertise in human, animal and environmental coronavirus surveillance.
The network currently includes 36 laboratories from 21 countries in all 6 WHO regions.

                              <span>Most prescriptions are still paper-based in secondary care. Business analyst Andy Harrison describes the technical groundwork we‚Äôve laid to allow these settings to go digital.


The little green FP10 paper prescriptions have all but disappeared in primary care. 18 years ago, we launched the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)¬†and it has since become an indispensable tool for primary care teams. Nearly all GP practices use it and about 95% of primary care prescriptions are now sent electronically. Last year, that amounted to 1 billion items dispensed using the service. It‚Äôs a safer, faster and more convenient way to prescribe.</span>
