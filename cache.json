The vast majority of lives saved – 101 million – were those of infants. \nThe study, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), shows that immunization is the single greatest contribution of any health intervention to ensuring babies not only see their first birthdays but continue leading healthy lives into adulthood. \nOf the vaccines included in the study, the measles vaccination had the most significant impact on reducing infant mortality, accounting for 60% of the lives saved due to immunization. This vaccine will likely remain the top contributor to preventing deaths in…",

          "description": "A new oral vaccine for cholera has received prequalification by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 April. The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. \n“The new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. “The new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.”\nWHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S.  \nVaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.  \nThere were 473 000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",

You can never meet demand. Because patients don't pay they have no respect for your time, opinion or you! Good analogy is if McDonald's said right everything free 24/7 would they ever meet demand? Nope! \n Here there is a copay it forces people to use their common sense first like use a pharmacist, self care etc also as they pay they respect your opinion and your time also. They are also far more polite. \n Also you can be a PCP in internal medicine only here so I only see adults no children. Salary of 300k is also very good for a max of 18 patients a day.

So is the locum market similar to this and given the current downturn in the market, could it pick up and boom once again? \n Appreciate it's a lot down to government funding for practices and changes with the expansion of ARRS roles, however would like to know people's experiences being GP locums \n    submitted by    /u/GPfinancelife  \n [link]   [comments]",

You get relocation money plus a very good pension scheme 401k etc \n \nCopays - As patients pay directly towards your consultation they have much more respect for you and your time. Also they will try self care, pharmacy etc etc. They also know it's easy for a Dr to code their visit in such a way their bill will be jacked up to the max (level 4 consult) so they know it's in their interests to be polite to you. Patients know full well things cost and are less demanding as a result \n \nStaffing - much better support staff here who do obs before you see the patient and also handle the paperwork\n \nPatient numbers - I only see max 18 a day and that is rare. Get 40 mins - 1hr for physical and new patients and 20 mins for follow ups\n \n Disadvantage\n I would say main one is hassle with insurance companies but our support staff deal with that a lot and take away the burden. \n    submitted by    /u/fred66a  \n [link]   [comments]",

But some questions required much more information than I could realistically process or document or the form. So I wrote 'see full medical records\n This was then queried, so i said can attach full medical record if the patient consents.\n But I feel this might have been the wrong advice. A) don't think should really be providing full medical records to insurance companies unless patients really request it B) think if so, would need to go through the notes and redact any 3rd party info. \n I'm not sure how to rectify this situation. It was only a few days ago - so i will ask team not to contact pt/release any info. And I can suggest that the form needs repeating.\n But I'm not sure how to complete the form.

I'm not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation.

No pharma company involved.\n Whilst Bianchi is a superior reoair, standard NHS bunion repair = Invasive procedure using a purchased medical device (screw).\n Example 2:\n Inguinal hernia repair\n Desarda technique = A strip of external oblique is stitched to inguinal ligaments and internal oblique. Wonderful natural muscle graft. \n Whilst desarda is superior, NHS repair = A piece of purchased polypropylene stitched into your abdominal wall.

But the surgeries were arguable performed due to the stents being a medical product was being pushed and purchased. \n Example 4\n Fasting. \n The health benefits are endless. Reverse insulin resistance, autophagy etc etc\n Fasting doesn’t involve any prescriptions, so doesn’t seem to be recommended.\n How many GP’s/consultants prescribe a 10 day fast?\n \n I can go private and see doctors with views that differ from the masses.

I was at a point where I questioning my decision to be in GP training. Thanks to the weekly teaching group sessions at the time, I could understand that experience can vary greatly between practices and therefore decided it would be sensible to stay on to see how things go in my next primary care rotation.

          "description": "What?\n We need to take action against the General Medical Council and their anti-doctor agenda. By endorsing MAP expansion, they are undermining the medical profession and risking patient safety. However, unregistered medical practice is illegal, and unless the BMA coordinates a campaign, we must continue to pay GMC registration fees. \n The GMC encourages doctors to pay registration fees by direct debit. Direct debits have the lowest admin burden for the GMC and low transaction fees. \n Essentially, if you pay via direct debit, the GMC keeps more of your money and has to spend less on processing the payment.\n However, the GMC allows you to pay your registration fee by other methods:\n  \nCredit/debit card\n Cheque\n Postal order\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6niyr3k8zxc1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=7041dc4cf411d8967c4901c072371d9f1af2b7c4\n So what?\n These other payment methods will cost the GMC more to process and administer. \n Card payments are associated with higher payment processing fees. Cheques and postal orders will require more administrative staff to manage and process them.\n Mass cancellation of direct debits would send a message to GMC management, and may force them to acknowledge the strength of feeling amongst the medical profession.\n However, you would need to remember to pay via these other methods - one advantage of direct debits is that they are automated.\n Now what?\n We're open to any suggestions you have about this idea. This would require a coordinated campaign to raise awareness and encourage doctors to switch their GMC payment method.\n We have considered alternative options, but withholding GMC fees is only feasible if the BMA backs a campaign and provides protection for doctors. The GMC removes doctors who do not pay fees from the medical register, so you won't be able to work. They'll also inform the police if you continue to practise medicine!\n DefundtheGMC\n    submitted by    /u/defundthegmc  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am very confused as I do not know what rotations I will be returning to as I cannot ask my scheduled f2 rotations rota coordinator about taking accrued annual leave as I still have 2 Fy1 rotations to repeat\n I have explained this to medical staffing multiple times in emails but no one seems to understand and keep telling me to go to the foundation school. \n The foundation school keep referring me back to medical staffing as annual leave is an ‘employment issue’ and not something they would address.\n I am really confused on what my next steps are and how to actually contact someone about my accrued annual leave, \n Need to sort out housing and location for maternity leave and knowing whether I can take those accrued days would be very useful but have been back and forth emailing for weeks without a proper response.\n Any advice would be greatly appreciated \n    submitted by    /u/Accomplished-Use-108  \n [link]   [comments]",

That’s why I have decided to reach out to you for advice. \n Little Background information:\n I have just completed my 3rd year in Dentistry in Scotland. My girlfriend whom I’ve met at uni is just completing her first Foundation Year down in England. I am trying to find out about her career options, in order to figure out how we can end up living and working in the same place again. We both have EU passports if that is of any help. \n I am completely new to this, and that is why I have a lot of questions. I will appreciate any help and advice. \n What are the career options for medics straight out of foundation year program? \n How does one enter specialty training after completing FYP? What are the requirements? Do you have to complete Medical core training first? Can you pick the place you want to do your specialty training or are you allocated to it randomly? Can you start your specialty training in one city and finish it in a different one? Should you go into specialty training straight after finishing FYP or is it better to gain some experience working first? \n Working abroad:\n What are common destinations for medics to work abroad, having finished medicine in UK? Where in EU is it possible for UK doctors to work? If you want to complete specialty training in EU or move forward with your medical career, do you have to speak the national language, or are there countries where you will just be fine with English? I am aware lots of medics end up moving to Australia. What does enrolling into specialty training programme for a UK do it or look like in Australia? Is it feasible? \n I am aware it’s a lot of questions, but I would be grateful for any help! \n    submitted by    /u/IntelligentTalk8419  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, was hoping that someone here would be able to give me some advice/guidance.\n I'm a final year medical student due to start working as an FY1 doctor in July/August this year. I unfortunately didn't get the region/group that I wanted within my deanery, but had been coming to terms with this (my partner and friends all got their top choice region).\n Whilst contacting one of the trust administrators for a different issue, they advised me that one of my rotations within my FY1 year has changed (to a less desired one for me), and also that my job is a GP LIFT programme, where I will have to work a day a week in a local GP practice.\n The LIFT aspect wasn't advertised anywhere in the ranking process or individual job description; when I told them this, they told me that the individual programme code (being FPP instead of the standard code) indicated this despite it not being mentioned that this was the case anywhere, nor was there any other evidence of this elsewhere. \n I don't particularly want to do the LIFT aspect and would much rather do the normal programme as it was advertised to me. Overall the randomised job allocation process has affected me quite negatively and now this is just another aspect which feels completely out of my control. \n I've contacted the BMA about this but they advised me that my trust is acting as mandated per my deanery, and that because the deanery is not directly an NHS employer they are not obligated by law to engage with the BMA; therefore the BMA cannot help me with this. \n Is there anything I can do about this? If so, how should I go about doing it? Any advice would be much appreciated as I've found this whole process quite overwhelming and I'm not sure where to go from here.

I’ve taken a month off and being treated for anxiety and depression. I’ve spoken to my supervisors and they have not been very supportive. My clinical was very flippant and made me feel less than. \n No one seems to understand how difficult I find adjusting to new rotations every four months and how only having my first medical job now - psych, surgery, medicine - means I feel grossly underprepared and under confident compared to my colleagues. On this new rotation I’m expected to see my own patients on ward round and there are no reg’s to ask advice. I understand how this may be realistic for approaching the end of F1 but I feel I’ve drawn the short straw having never seen medical patients independently until now. So I spend the whole day doubting my decisions and when I get home I’m usually tearful or just numb. I don’t have any friends or colleagues in F1 to talk to I am so alone. \n As F2 approaches I do not feel ready - part of me is relieved at my ARCP likely being extended due to illness and not meeting portfolio requirements. I think about alternative careers every single day as I have not enjoyed one day of F1. But I feel like a failure contemplating leaving what I’ve worked so long for. It’s to the point where I’m having frequent passive thoughts of ending my own life.\n I’ve had advice to continue and pursue a career in psychiatry - which I am interested in but the thought of another year of hospital medicine is daunting. \n Has anyone felt like this and kept going? Any experience with mental health and ARCP being extended? Should I leave now? Any other advice at all would be appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/Throwaway_84856  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can't get study leave for a course for the same reasons even after a request for cover from my ES.

I genuinely don't know what they get paid for other than saying computer says no.\n I don't have a job lined up for next year, didn't want to have to go straight into specialty training but don't think I would've got in anyway. Every med ed post or JCF that I've applied to I've been rejected from without even a chance at interview because so many people with MRCP/MRCS are applying.\n I genuinely love being a doctor when I get to do my job and I don't even care about the pay anymore.

Do you just get told you need more evidence for the appraisal?\n \nIn terms of restoring a license to practice, I'm assuming that's a lengthy and more difficult process?\n \n Basically just any advice would be much appreciated, I've tried asking around and reading online but bit confused on what happens if you're taking multiple years out. Thanks for your help :)\n    submitted by    /u/East-Veterinarian-3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Looking at it from my perspective, neurosurgery is usually only in the big tertiary centres, and they always seem to be inundated with referrals and emergency cases, but for some reason there are limited training posts and even more limited new consultant posts. \n In the big tertiary centres I’ve worked in, neurosurgery can always be found cracking out emergencies day and night. Surely it can’t be good to have brain abscesses and bleeds waiting for hours and hours when they’re Cat 1 cases? \n Is it that there’s no funding for more consultant posts or are the current consultants ladder pulling because there’s so little private work to corner? Just speculating here sorry. \n I know we all moan when referring to neurosurgery as you’ve got an ill patient with intracranial pathology who may or may not need intervention, but the poor neuro reg is filtering referrals from all these other DGHs in between cracking open craniums.

I heard a consultant tell a trainee acp in the midst of doctors that when she qualifies that there is nothing a doctor can do that she won't be able to do legally except signing death certificates, that it would even change soon.😳😳\n So dear doctors, the only thing that makes you and I different from ACPS is that we can sign death certificates and cremation forms\n An ACP can pick up doctor locums as well as nurse/pharmacy, OT, physio locums as the case may be. Why are we not pretending like ACP is not a better thing to be instead of a non consultant doctor.

          "description": "Would really appreciate some advice on this please. I am a medic applying for a group 1 specialty and would like to go LTFT (80%) for specialty training for mental health reasons. \n Without going into too much detail, I have done all of my training so far full time, but the last couple of years of IMT were a real struggle and whilst I managed to finish without any sick leave, I was very close to not being alive at multiple points. My IMT TPD was not really aware of any of this - there were some wellbeing concerns raised at one point but they were put down to other issues, and I think most colleagues would be very surprised if they found out about my diagnosis (and just to be very clear, there have never been any concerns about me clinically and my MSFs/WPBAs have always been very good). I am doing better now and have good support in place, however, because of how bad things got during IMT, and because the nature of my illness means I am likely to get unwell again, I really want to work LTFT in order to try and have some breathing space should things start to go south again. \n My question is, how much of the above should I disclose to my TPD when discussing my LTFT application? Should I tell them my diagnosis and how bad things got? I really want to make the most of HST because I missed out on loads of opportunities during IMT because of my mental health, and if there is support they can give such as allowing me to go LTFT, I really want to make the most of it, but equally, I don't want people to be prejudiced because of my diagnosis. Or even worse, not believing me because I have managed to work full time so far (I can provide evidence of my issues though as I have letter from Practitioner Health etc.). \n I would be grateful for some advice regarding this from anyone who has been through something similar (or from anyone consultants who have been on the other end). \n    submitted by    /u/Tasty_Discipline_102  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was a patient who was referred to us on non-rebreath and in deteriorating T1RF. The bay only had 1 oximetry. The nurse assistant was doing her obs round at the time. While I was reviewing the patient with the reg, I asked the NA if I can borrow the machine. The NA told me to get my hands off the machine and I am not allowed to use the machine. At the moment, I couldn’t be asked to care about what she was saying. So I apologised to her and explained that this was a critically unwell patient (no pun intended). Then I took the machine to attend the patient. After our review, the charge nurse had a go at me… essentially chastising me for being condescending to the NA. She also threatened to notify my ES. After years of service in the NHS, passing exams, playing the portfolio game, it frustrates me to say this…but I dislike where we are as modern day doctors. \n    submitted by    /u/StrongPassion3366  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was in theatre recently shadowing an anaesthetist who told me he keeps a logbook for all his cases for appraisal purposes. This got me wondering if there’s any benefit in starting a logbook for all the cases I take part in? For example, I have I inserted a decent number of Igels so far. Hoping to get more experience in airway management. Has anyone ever done this? If so, which logbook did they use?

I'm very grateful to get into training, especially considering the tight competition for SHO posts.\n However, even though I've accepted the post, I'm still considering moving to Australia. Since I'm from Asia, Australia is definitely closer than the UK, making it easier to travel home for emergencies.\n The only thing holding me back is the requirement to work in a non-training post for over a year before applying for Australian training programs, as I understand PR is necessary. Additionally, I'm unsure about the competitiveness of getting into GP or IMT in Australia.\n Therefore, I'm debating whether to commit to the GP training program for the next three years until CCT before moving to Australia.\n I'd love to hear from people who have recently moved to Australia post-CCT or after FY2 for their insights. Thank you very much!\n Edit for additional info:\n The reason I chose GP training here in the UK is because it was the shortest route to CCT. But I'm actually unsure if I want to become a GP.

I've had some wellbeing issues raised from others (mainly they can see my mood is low/I catastrophise when anything goes wrong or I feel like I've done a bad job). They've spoke to my supervisor who has spoken to me and I'm going through CBT for this and regularly checking in with my supervisor who has been very supportive. \n I found out from my supervisor (they knew this already but didn't mention anything till I mentioned the issues, think they were waiting till I was in a better headspace maybe) one senior trainee raised patient safety concerns. My supervisor agreed I should speak to the senior trainee to get a better idea of what happened. I think these were mainly related to a couple procedures a month or two ago in which they asked if they could take over as I'd tried for a while and things weren't working - I said I wanted the usual one more go for around maybe a minute or so then accepted defeat. The main reason I was hesitant was I didn't want to look incapable and handing it over meant that would go down as a failure. No harm came to the patients as far as I know anyway. I spoke to the senior trainee today but they just said I should speak again to my supervisor and said their main focus was patient safety. Made me feel like crap for sure as I'd hate to be unsafe and always have this fear. Prior to this never had any issues like this raised.\n I'll speak to my supervisor again and see about more details. I'm wondering if anyone has advice about managing this, how to get over this feeling of worry and I guess that concern about feeling safe- there doesn't seem to be any concern from my supervisor and I'm still on rota working independently etc if this makes a difference.

Clinical experience (no matter what specialty) makes us better clinicians and more well-rounded doctors, and I don't think anyone should be penalized for that.

There is no other career that requires its professionals to decrease their salaries in order to train. \n Is pay protection something we should be pushing for? Is the BMA looking into this?

          "description": "I’m a final-year medical student, starting F1 in August. In my last few weeks of placement, I’ve started wearing a bit of makeup in the hospital. \n When I say makeup, I just mean some basic foundation, mascara, bit of blush, bit of eyeshadow, nothing particularly striking. Basically what I would put on if I was going out for a meal with friends or maybe an informal date. However, what has been striking is the very noticeable difference in how I’m treated. I’m always keen and try to be enthusiastic, so normally after a couple of days of turning up for things the docs will be relatively nice and friendly to me, but it’s definitely only after ‘proving’ myself. Totally fair enough, they get lots of med students passing through. By contrast, I feel like I’ve been treated better and felt welcomed from the get-go. Not many concrete differences that I could point to, mainly just warmer tone and body language, although one of the docs even offered to talk me through a procedure rather than me having to ask. \n Now, I’d love to believe that everyone is just a bit nicer here, but realistically I know I look prettier with a bit of makeup and let’s be honest, pretty privilege is real and it seems like it’s at least a contributing factor to being treated differently. Anyone else experienced this whilst working? I know it varies significantly from team to team as so whether most people wear makeup or not - what’s the standard practice in your department? \n I don’t really desire to wear makeup every day but if it means I’m likely to be treated that much better as an F1 then I think I’ll have to…\n    submitted by    /u/LilacPuddle  \n [link]   [comments]",

By the end of my appointment, we had a plan and I was whisked off for further tests. He also gently challenged me and we had a discussion around the process of behaviour change. \n I work in the NHS in community mental health so I know how pressured everyone is. I wanted to express my gratitude because so much clinical responsibility falls on your shoulders. I follow this sub because we often have student doctors visiting and have psychiatry trainees; I really enjoy working with them and want to have an appreciation of how difficult things are. I try making sure they’re invited to all the staff nights out, meals, and shepherd them out the door if they’re working as late as me. \n Anyway, a big thank you for all you do.

I don't want to doxx myself but the police enquiry wasn't successful for a variety of reasons I can't go into.\n The investigation with the GMC was very thorough and they took multiple statements from me. It was extremely scary going to the hearing (I gave evidence both virtually and in person) but the tribunal members were very respectful. They did ask some inappropriate questions but they just needed to clarify I did not behave in a way that warranted him to touch me. \n He ended up getting erased from the medical register. I've not had any contact with him apart from the hearing and I'll be moving to a different deanery at the end of F2 so will be able to put everything behind me.\n I've also been in therapy since the incident and have healed in lots of ways. I've spoken with a lot of colleagues and it is surprisingly common but very few doctors report it. I hope that if someone can relate then they will have some hope that the system can protect you.

I would like to apply to core training in psychiatry but I need a signed crest form. My consultants are not sure if they can sign that form because of the 1st competency \"1.1 Clinical assessment Assess patient needs in a variety of clinical settings including acute, non-acute and community \" They are saying acute setting can only be in general hospitals. Is that true? Because of the current competition for nontraining junior jobs I couldn't get an interview from general hospitals so far.

How is that equivalent to an ACP with 3 years experience and no formal examinations?\n I'm out here, unable to get into EM training and also getting rejected from ITU CDFs yet my department are increasing the number of ACPs and I'm watching them get more training than they ever invest into me.\n The ACPs are lovely people but half of them can't interpret an ABG and are not functioning at the level I'd expect from an FY1 in ED. The other half are very good at their jobs, but why are we training them instead of doctors?

Due to the strikes, locum budgets have been slashed. PAs and ACPs will ofc be used as replacements for doctors in all but name. \n If you haven't entered training, or already got a JCF lined up, the next year of unemployment (because that's what a locum F3 is) will be scary. \n Try to get on as many banks as possible and join locum agencies. Good luck guys. \n In my opinion, it's better to enter training in something you have 0 interest in and at least pay the bills than risk locumming. Of course there will be some work, but you may go weeks / months without any stable work. This will not be comfortable. \n Our progression is so low. The F3 used to be a mini lucrative break that we'd get from the hell of foundation year, and now the current generation of foundation docs will lose out on that. Many of us used F2 to buy a home or pay for weddings. \n It is now more important than ever to get FPR and to also become much more protectionist with our profession - stop training ACPs/PAs that just ultimately kill the locum and job market for us. \n Strike hard \n    submitted by    /u/DNARplz  \n [link]   [comments]",

This was largely due to his desire to avoid NHS strikes which probably gave BMA Scotland a lot of leverage. \n Now we’re going to have a new FM; which may be another SNP politician, or we could be heading to the polls if an FM cannot be found who has the confidence of parliament. \n I have to wonder where this will leave us with negotiations.

I feel the need to be seen as a ‘good’ SHO, I really don’t need to be the best by any means but don’t want to be seen as bad. \n For example, I see 200 patients and try and sort them, but if something isn’t done like say the porters aren’t down for X-ray by handover time (although I’ve chased them over and over), then I feel completely shite like it’s my fault. If a referral isn’t done by handover time after chasing then it’s my fault. Put those two things together in one handover then I go home thinking about it and can’t sleep. \n How do you guys manage this?

If someone does, say 50% to make it simple, how does that affect the frequency of these shifts? \n Usually on-calls and nights are 4 days in a row each once a month (I'm sure it varies between specialities, but this seems to be the most common), if you're working 50% of the time - does that mean you work 2 days worth of on calls and 2 days of nights per month or is it more than you'd still do your run of 4 days, but its done over 2 months instead? Or is it something differently entirely? Same for weekends, if you have 1 in 3 weekends full time, does that become 1 in 6 if you're LTFT 50%?\n Appreciate the help in advance, thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/DolphinFlips  \n [link]   [comments]",

We don't have to like Dr Dan Poulter for his decision. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68913287 but fine if you do.\n I'm afraid things in the political realm do affect the state of the NHS - the evidence is overwhelming. Do you need a list? Start with Doctors' pay if you wish. Dr Poulter's decision is a slap in the face for the regime that has prevailed over decimation of the NHS over15 years.\n This thread is not intent on being a political discussion about whether the NHS is safer in on or the other party's hands, please!\n Dr Poulter's decision is nonetheless an important signal to the general public and to doctors. \n Whatever happens radical change will be needed on how the NHS is managed. \n Let's keep the discussion in that area - irrespective of politics.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I am going to start FY1 this August and fortunately, I am one of the luckier students who already know what city I will be working in. Fortunately, it is also a city that I did my degree in and the plan was to stay in the same apartment while I do FY.\n Unfortunately, I had to make a difficult decision to split up with my long term partner who I am currently living with. I would like to find a new flat for myself, however, I am not sure if I will be a good candidate for this as I still do not have an employment contract (or a guarantor), even though I have been allocated jobs.\n Is it possible to move apartments this soon before starting FY and still sound credible to the landlord? Is there a letter that my employer can write that would state I will be starting a job in August if I fulfill all the requirements (eg GMC registration, finishing my degree)? My understanding is that you can only receive the actual contract much closer to the start date of your job so how do people manage to get a flat without moving last minute when they are allocated to a new part of the country? Am I fucked?\n    submitted by    /u/Bitter_Square3228  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Bring back paternalistic medicine! \n Patients don't always know what is best for them. Quite frankly a lot of the general public don't have enough knowledge to be able to properly weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of complex treatment options, and we don't have the time to fully explain things in a way that these people will understand. We should make the decision and present the best option to them. I've seen too many patients recently make stupid choices regarding treatment because they don't understand the chances of success and failure. \n Example: Experienced vascular consultant gives patient option A and option B. Option A is to do partial foot amputation. Consultant informs patient that the resulting wound is extremely unlikely to heal due to PVD and that they will almost definitely need to return to surgery to do below knee amputation. Option B is to go straight to below knee amputation which will result in less time in hospital overall. Patient discussed with surgeon and agrees option B. Then family show up and are informed of plan and say \"No, absolutely not. We want a second opinion\". Patient then doesn't want to upset family and decides to choose option A. Patient has surgery, surgery fails, patient returns to theatres several weeks later. Leg is chopped off. Length of stay is longer. NHS has spent all the extra money of the first surgery for no reason. \n Surely it would have been better for the consultant to say \"This is the surgery that we need to do. It is the only option. Anything less will fail and I will not do pointless operations that have an extremely small chance of success*\"?\n *Unless lack of treatment would result in certain death anyway.\n    submitted by    /u/FuneralExitOffspring  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ensure I discuss most patients with the GPs to double check my plans or if I am unsure of what is going on. Despite this, I have found that I have already made 2 mistakes so far. One of them is a prescribing one where I prescribed a longer course of a medication than recommended as I think I misunderstood the GP's advice, I fortunately picked up on it when reading yesterday and will call the patient to let them know before it has any impact on them but this has made me anxious and underconfident. I have very rarely made an impactful mistake in hospital and I unfortunately have this overthinking habit so I struggle with uncertainty and will read up about anything I am unsure about after a work day to learn from it and as a coping mechanism. The downside to this is that I end up identifying issues more than my peers and while this helps patients, it also makes me doubt myself and I worry about my patients and the GPs losing trust in me. I wonder if there is any way to manage these feelings of guilt and under-confidence for doctors who have been in this situation before?

And I can feel that she feels distasteful about me ever since I’ve started in Psych. \n I love Psychiatry, and I want to continue doing it. But even in the hospitals I have noticed that our patients are not very fond of us, most of dislike us. Which to me is understandable, since we section them, give them depots. \n After this I made a mistake of looking it up online- why do people hate psychiatrists, and I found so much hate. \n This makes me miss my rotations in medicine, because I felt more appreciated and rewarded by the patients. However, in psychiatry it’s just soo common to go through racial abuse, verbal abuse, threats, and I can go on and on.\n I don’t know, what is your take on it?

Partner has her own work and it's now dawning upon us that the move may not be that easy.\n I have seen the form on ORIEL whereby you can reapply to continue your training in another region whereby you continue at ST4. In essence, you reapply in open competition with the only difference being you have to upload a form with your current TPD supporting your application.\n My issue now is, is it worth doing this? The application window for the speciality basically opens up at the same time I start ST3 in October. Does it look bad approaching TPD to ask him to sign the form at the start of my training? Will he think badly of this. And say I am not successful in reapplying, will the current TPD then screw me over for the rest of my rotations thinking this person didn't even want to be here in the first place?\n Some of my friends are saying it's worth reapplying in open competition whilst retaining my NTN.

People who don't know this language can't pronounce my name correctly not because it’s hard to pronounce but because they read it literally.

Up until now, I never corrected my colleagues and patients to pronounce my name as it's spelled, but that's not how it's really pronounced, and I wonder whether I should start correcting them (as I am starting to feel a bit uncomfortable). People don’t get my name right at first attempt, and when my colleagues are present, they often correct my pronunciation of my name (me: “I’m Jana” … someone “sorry what’s your name again?” … my colleague “Yana”… someone “Ah okay I got it! Nice to meet you, Yana”) \n Would it be too complicated to introduce myself by saying, \"The spelling is Jana, but the pronunciation is Yana\"?

A 24yo woman presented with soft tissue injuries and dislocated shoulder, with a weekly alcohol intake of 34 units. Audit-C score was 7, but CIWA-A was only 1. No symptoms of AWS. A dispute started between the F1 doing the clerking and the bay nurse, about whether she needed immediate benzodiazepine treatment to prevent withdrawal seizures.\n It escalated in a ridiculous way to include the registrar on duty, then the charge nurse, then the ward sister. Their position was that we should give the full protocol, ours was that she'd been assessed at low risk and wasn't dependent. The charge nurse started threatening 'Datix for patient safety' and trying to strongarm the F1 into prescribing.\n The argument ended when the professor in charge of the take wandered towards the noise we were making. He listened for a minute, flicked through the patient notes briefly, glanced at the numbers, then turned to the charge nurse. \"My alcohol intake's higher than that, where's my benzodiazepines?\" Held out his hand and started making 'gimme' gestures. No response.\n Long story short, we stopped being asked to prescribe the meds.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Staterae  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm considering throwing in the towel on medicine. Training in the UK is increasingly becoming incompatible with my life aims (yes, more so than they were before). Throughout medical school I wanted to be a psychiatrist, it was the area I was always most passionate about and genuinely exceeded at, whereas I was a very underachieving student elsewise.\n I can't help but feel a degree of resentment to those who are applying to psych despite likely having no actual specific interest in the field. This is undoubtedly selfish, but I feel like my field of passion has practically been stripped away from me, as I'm only able to work in a very specific area of the country due to family commitments. \n I'm stuck locuming with the threat of redundancy looming over me, and honestly I'm spending half my time in a state of anxiety and uncertainty.\n I'm wondering whether it might be time to get off the medicine wagon and give myself space to breath and retrain as a Psychotherapist.\n Would this be a practical move? \n    submitted by    /u/ThatKetoneSmell  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, \n I received superb, expert, compassionate and life-improving care from my local eye hospital. I suffered eye trauma in a freak accident, and thanks to your colleagues I've gone from a traumatic cataract, >60 intra-ocular pressure and other assorted grievances to successful surgery, dramatically improved vision and a low, manageable risk of glaucoma. \n I want to thank the brilliant people who helped me, in a way that gives them the recognition they deserve from the brass! No doubt they'll have handled much more serious matters than mine, but this was a scary episode nonetheless. Their skill and compassion made me feel safe - a profoundly valuable thing at a time of vulnerability. \n I gather that an email to PALS helps with the portfolio. What I'd like to know specifically: \n  \nWill a single email about everyone suffice? I don't remember everyone's name (I was seen by a lot of people), but should be able to provide enough identifying info. \n Will the brass read it?\n Will it be seen by the people themselves? On a personal level, I'd like them to know just how much I appreciate them.\n \n A couple of nuggets stand out: \n  \nThe doctor in A&E who calmed me and made me laugh when I was freaking out about my 60+ IOP, and who also had the humility to say that she had to check what to do with the glaucoma consultant. Knowing what you don't know and admitting it is surely the most noble form of intelligence. \n The consultant herself. I suppose we expect consultants to be expert and decisive (she was both), but she was also approachable, attentive and friendly over multiple appointments. \n  \nIt occurs to me that bedside manner is more memorable to patients than hard-earned clinical skill. Perhaps that's just because we understand it better. Anyway, it stays with you, and I salute you all for retaining your humanity in a society that under-values you. \n Sorry for banging on. All insights into what's best for your colleagues are welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/onion-face  \n [link]   [comments]",

Struggling to be present, a little more anxious, and just not as happy.\n Only made the realisation today that a big part of it will be unfulfillment at work. On medicine I was seeing patients independently, having good relationships with seniors, and feeling like a valued member of the medical team. On surgery, the seniors haven't even bothered to learn my name, I am not using my clinical brain whatsoever, and I spend all day doing ward jobs.\n I don't want to feel like this for the next 3.5 months.

Been doing F3 and F4 locums via an agency (will keep their name off here) and have spoken to one of my colleagues about the use of umbrella companies. He has informed me that he uses the same company and is getting full take home pay and is sorting out his taxes with his accountants. He has said he has been happy with this arrangement but has recently found out through 2 different agency staff that used to work at this company that they where actually not paying the VAT and the agency staff would take a fixed percentage of this on a weekly basis in forms of a bonus from the \"umbrella company\". \n I was shocked by this and have spoken to a few agencies about this and been advised that there is only two companies that allow this practise and I am shocked and appalled by this. I've calculated it to be that some people can be making £2000 per week from their locum doctors. I have no proof other then these conversations but am I right to feel concerned and what is the best practise?

          "description": "Hello all,\n It's your friendly neighbourhood IMG, who has never lived in London. I got offered a post in the South London Deanery, and I could use your expert opinions.\n The first thing that I am worried about is the cost of living. Will I be able to afford to live on my own in London with the salary of an ST3? Seeing that now I am almost 30 years old, I think I am ready to start making a step ahead in my life and try to get my own place. I dread the fact that I might be going into my early 30s and not being able to afford to live on my own. \n The second thing that I would like to ask for your advice on is which areas of London would you advise me to seek a house in. My deanery is going to be in South London, but I have heard rumours that it can be quite dangerous. I have never lived in a dangerous city in the past and I would rather avoid areas with high criminal rates. Which areas would you recommend? Do you think it is a good idea to live above the river and commute every day?\n One final thing that I would like to mention is that currently I am not able to afford a car, as I have spent a fortune on my Royal College exams, courses, study material etc. Will I be able to reach the hospitals in my Deanery using public transport or is owning a car a must?\n Many thanks! xoxo\n    submitted by    /u/DeadlyAssassins9  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like the title says, I’m expecting to be involved in an SI. For obvious reasons I will be very vague about the details. \n My biggest mistake was not documenting that I escalated it to the consultant, because consultants are notoriously bad at documenting their actions thereafter so I guess on paper it looks like I was the last contact with the patient. Before I knew the final patient outcome, I told the consultant about my anxiety around the situation and they said “it’s fine, you escalated it to me, it was my responsibility”, but obviously I didn’t write that on paper and they didn’t document anything after that. \n Fully expecting to be contacted about this case and am beyond anxious about how it will play out. \n I’m a foundation year. Will involvement in something like this affect my future career? \n As soon as I felt out of my depth with the symptoms, that’s when I handed it over to the consultant. Technically the symptom was escalated to me, but I didn’t know what to do so I escalated further. We all know the first month of rotation is very much finding your feet, I had no idea what to do in this specific situation, hence the further escalation as I wasn’t getting anywhere. If something goes wrong, do consultants often field the responsibility and inquests themselves or do they often bounce the blame back at the more junior doctor? \n I’m absolutely terrified and this physical and overwhelming anxiety is enough to make me seriously question a future in this career. I don’t ever want to be involved in this stuff but it seems like perfect storms happen and I fucking hate this \n    submitted by    /u/throwawayclosureex  \n [link]   [comments]",

Infact more gruelling than my previous job in ED. Most people seem to only be able to tolerate 6-7 sessions/wk. As a salaried that can be as low as 66-77k a year. As a clinical fellow in ED I was making 63k after banding. Like...what is the point in being a salaried GP? \n Like I can genuinely make more than this, if I currently go back to work as a clinical fellow job in Wales,Scotland or NI. It would probably be easier too.\n Last week, my supervisor the other week said to me \"it's true the job market is bad. It's true that you are competing with ARRs roles\". So I have to work super hard for 66-77k. Pathetic. Why not just retrain in literally any speciality in Wales?\n I don't understand. I really like this country and want to work here.

Also find it bizarre most claim not to be trained in taking bloods from children and expect an F1 or any other doctor who doesn’t come across children nearly as much as them to do the bloods instead. Paediatric trainee doctors constantly have to do their own urine dipsticks and observations - can their HCA/nurses not do this? Adult nurses are also busy but they don’t go around saying “im busy I’ll try if I can get round to it” when you ask them to do the most basic thing. Also paediatric nurses when they speak to speciality teams honestly just come across as rude and entitled and quick to behave passive aggressively or straight up rude.

I had prepared very well only to be thrown under the bus in the interview. The clinical scenarios were much harder than previous years and I feel like the whole interview process was just poorly delivered.

I've taken a more chilled approach this year as it doesn't seem to be quite the mega competition of core training (yet....) and my mental health is sort of in the toilet.\n I'd love 1-2 years out to decompress, see the world, see family, be a normal non doctor human. I'm pre kids so I could have a lot of freedom and nice times. Or I could aim for ST4 next round starting training in Feb 2025 (if I'm lucky, there should be numbers in areas of country I'd like to live in).....\n Is being a consultant lots better? Should I be pushing towards consultancy soon and ending the misery of med reg night shifts and rotating? Or will I be a 35 year old consultant with a couple of kids regretting prioritising my career over a couple of fufilling years out of training?\n I'm female and expect to take a few mat leaves and then LTFT so I suspect I won't get there very fast regardless, it's whether or not I add 1-2 years extra on by taking some time to chill now vs cracking on with HST for a couple years at 100%. We see young people die at work which I think skews my view that life is short and work doesn't matter all that much.\n I'd love to hear from anyone who entered ST4 after a couple of years out, do you regret it now when you see people who were at your stage and are now consultants whilst you're still working nights? Or do you feel lucky that you had amazing experiences that you just can't have in your 40s/50s when tied down by kids and a mortgage?\n P.S. I really like my family/friends in the UK, so despite the absolutely appalling weather I don't want to CCT and flee so this would be based on life staying in the UK for the long term\n    submitted by    /u/ProfessionalBruncher  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'll start off with fonts and styles. This may be of importance to those doctors whose work is text-intensive and where quality of presentation matters e.g. senior doctors in psychiatry and expert witness doctors. \n In psychiatry the work is text intensive for producing reports of various kinds: Tribunal reports, Managers' reports, CPA, CTR, Court of Protection and so on. Presentancy is 'everything' (chuhknowwhuhahmean). Most 'medics' - or is that doctors - don't give a monkeys about fonts or Styles. Some don't know what's that Style ribbon at the top of MS Word is for, nor do their typists (secretaries or admins). I'm not doing a tutorial on that here. \n What is of relevance is that for the doctors who need to format there work for 'presentancy' and readability (like me) are being told that Trusts require all correspondence to be in Arial 12pt, by policy. No such policy has been found over the last 10 years of me searching for it across 10 Trusts. I dare say it does not exist.\n But wait - I started off with one issue to illustrate something else that happens in your beloved NHS What's that?\n Loads of people make up policies as they go along. The commonest is 'good practice'. Nobody quoting anything of 'good practice' has been able to provide me with a reference to the 'good practice'. \n The other one was \"No patient gets Sectioned unless they have a CTR (care and treatment review).\" No such policy exists in writing anywhere and if it exists it is legally wrong. \n And another, \"Intensive support must be consulted before a LD patient is sectioned\". Doesn't exist. Can't find that anywhere (though it may well exist in a neck of the woods somewhere that I've not been). \n I'd like to hear from those who have witnessed the same sort of making up of policies. \n    submitted by    /u/Capitan_Walker  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyways after resuscitation by the midwife, the buzzer was pulled as baby’s sats were still low despite inflation breaths, NG aspiration of stomach and subsequent face mask O2.\n In response to the buzzer and “paeds” being called, an ACP from paeds attended. She was great, and I learnt stuff from her when I was asking questions about management, and it seemed that everything right was done for baby.\n But an ACP? To essentially a crash call? For adults senior doctors attend. So what is going on here? The ACP seemed quite well versed in everything, but this doesn’t sit right with me. \n There was a point where the ACP said “if things don’t improve by x time, I’m calling my reg”, but why wasn’t a paediatrician there initially? NICU is on the same floor!!! \n I know that even paeds isn’t safe from scope creep and noctors, but can’t we get real doctors to attend to a neonatal emergency.\n Maybe this was because it hadn’t quite gotten to cardiac arrest?

Last week we had a student join us during the morning MDT meeting and introduced herself as a medical student. We did a few cases together during the week and she seemed uninterested in anything I had to teach but was very keen to jump in and take over the patient interviews. I didn't mind her confidence but she took irrelevant histories and didn't seem to understand a lot of basics. She always tried to go out of her way to agree with the consultant and it felt like she was trying to \"one up\" me. It really didn't seem like normal behaviour for a medical student so figured she was just a very driven student who had yet to start her downward journey on the dunning-kruger graph.\n I found out from one of the nurses that she was a nursing student, and was told many of them introduce themselves as medical students, which we agreed was disingenuous. She later confirmed that she would be finishing nursing school soon when asked in front of our MDT.\n I'm not originally from the UK, but is it normal for nursing students to identify themselves as medical students?

A few months ago I drafted a response to a bizarre patient complaint... the patient had booked an appointment under her name so her dog could get some antibiotics for a cough/chest infection. I'm not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation. Then she complained to the practice and when rebuffed, went to the NHS obusdman who shut her down too.

But spending months waiting for social issues to sort out, they keep getting new medical issues.\n Plus, there are chronic medical issues that families want taken care of, while they are in the hospital, as an opportunistic bonus.\n Now, its basically just me and a PA (nice but relatively new). Before, it was me and another SHO and we used to divide patients evenly.\n We're being told to prioritize TTOs rather than clinical reviews because pharmacy can't process orders (dosette boxes) in time if we do them after noon\n The issue at hand is that i usually need time to look at a patient my own way, and write in my own style. I'm a bit conscious of making sure that I'm not missing any key details when reviewing a patient, or that any TTO I write is well written.\n Also, the ward manager is insisting that instead of breaking up patients, we divide tasks instead. Things like \"Oh, the PA can write the discharge summary and you can prescribe.....\"\n The PA is a nice lady and she can take bloods decent enough...(somewhat)\n The problem is, I can't review patients late (all the investigation results and imaging gets delayed), and I seriously hate prescribing meds (Especially CDs) when the written portion is a missing key details (like why a drug was discontinued or whether a resus status was changed)\n I take pride in my work, and want to do it in its entirety.\n Does anyone how to handle this kinda workload?\n It's gotten so bad that normally, an MOFD patient is supposed to be reviewed every week just to see if they're ok, and no one's reviewing them for 2-3 weeks.\n    submitted by    /u/hadriancanuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

From 1 October 2022 Officer pension contribution tiers in England and Wales are linked to actual pensionable pay and not the notional full time equivalent rate.\"\n NHSBA seems to suggest differently \"Overtime, in relation to the NHS Pension Scheme, is hours worked in excess of the whole time standard working week. Therefore a part timer’s pensionable pay must include any additional hours worked up to the whole time working week, and hours worked over the whole time working week are not pensionable. For example, if the standard working week is 37.5 hours, a part timer normally working 20 hours a week may pay pension contributions on up to 17.5 additional hours per week.\"\n But then also this from NHSBA? \"The payroll solution must use the previous scheme years actual pensionable earnings to set the member contribution rate (instead of using whole-time equivalent earnings).

All exams have been passed and its just placements standing between me and working as a doctor. \n While I am excited, I'm starting to get really nervous. I'll be at a hospital I've never been at before, I don't know anyone else who will be working at that hospital. I know this is the same for most people, but I am really worried I won't find anyone to go through the tough stuff with - I feel like it's taken me all the years of medical school to finally find a group of people I'm at least semi-comfortable with. I feel like I'm just chronically misunderstood by peers and I am just worried about how everything will all go. \n I've already spoken to OH, they have mentioned something about a WRAP form but other than that I don't even know what can be done to help someone who's autistic in a ward setting. \n I guess I'm just starting to panic a bit. I suppose I'm looking for reassurance that foundation is doable, and maybe some tips if anyone has any. \n Thank you 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/desirablychaotic  \n [link]   [comments]",

When the patient left the clinic, the assistant immediately picked the 3£ gift and went: “Are we even allowed to accept that? I’ll put it in the staff room and you can help yourselves if you want you”\n I mean FFS !!!! Our assistants are so brainwashed from the ridiculously demeaning position of NHS doctors that they would not even have the courtesy to ask permission from the consultant, who the gift is presumably for and who is also in charge of their own clinic, before taking the gift away.\n I did a good job for my patient, my patient expressed their gratefulness by gifting a 3£ biscuit, I felt rewarded that they are grateful- but no, the NHS culture would make sure to remind us that we do not even deserve this gesture.\n I am so fed up with the recurrent manifestations of this upside down hierarchy at the NHS where everyone think, act and actually are the bosses except doctors. I think this culture towards doctors at the NHS is so bad that I doubt reversing it would happen in my lifetime and I would rather run away than spending my career devalued.\n Rant over\n Edit: typos\n    submitted by    /u/DecentTrouble94  \n [link]   [comments]",

The simulator is pretty simple: a mannequin, a monitor, some dummy drugs to be drawn up or checked, some blood gas print outs and people pretending to be nurses, registrars etc. The trainees are final year medical students, FY1s and FY2s. The simulated scenarios are vanilla adult medical and surgical emergencies in which the trainee is called to the ward for a patient that's \"gone off\".\n The scenarios themselves seem pretty realistic and I try to make the debriefings as educational as possible using the After Action Review model, but it seems the trainees get no particular preparation on emergencies before the simulation day and there's no follow up afterwards on lessons identified. It's just one or two simulator days a year in isolation.

It's been praised by both political parties, but criticised by trans groups and international organisations.\n Apart from the merits of these changes, does anyone know why this took the form of an independent service review rather than a national guideline by NICE/ RCPCH/ RCPsych or if there are plans to produce one in the future.

          "description": "Training places \n All specialities will trend towards how neurosurgery is today. Hyper competitive. Virtually impossible to obtain a training number post foundation for many years. This will force more and more doctors into locum work. \n Locum work \n The rise in foundation doctors not getting a training number, previous F3,4,5s etc, and IMGs will saturate the market to the extent that there will be very few locum opportunities, and the rate for locum SHOs will continue to fall. \n Unemployment \n Eventually the market becomes that saturated that essentially as an SHO who has just finished F2. You don’t have enough experience to secure a training number, and there are no locum opportunities. So what do you do? You’re essentially unemployed from a medical point of view. No fellowships, no trust grade jobs. All over subscribed. \n I give it 2-3 years before doctors unemployed in hundreds if not thousands. What can be done? I’m not sure if I’m being honest. I hope the BMA has plans, because honestly this is a much bigger issue than FPR. Actually in effect FPR probably further drives this issue as better pay means less people leave, and it’s more attractive to IMGs that will further up the competition for training numbers and saturate the locum market. (I’m still pro-FPR obviously just looking at it from a different angle 🦀). \n What do people think the answer is?\n All specialities have points in their self scoring for home grad preference?

I hope you can shine some light on my dilemma. \n I have recently been accepted for an MBA in a top business school with a 50% scholarship - which is still a big investment. For some context, I am an IMG doctor and I co-founded a startup in London after my foundation training which went well but never took off. Last year I decided that it was time to do something different and I applied for the MBA and took a Clinical Fellow post. During my Clinical fellow post (part-time) I rediscovered my passion for medicine and how nice it is to directly help people and I managed to get an IMT spot in the reserve list in an ok location. The MBA would give me a higher salary on a corporate job but it would take me away from medicine and I am not sure I am ready for it! I am thinking about declining or at least trying to defer the MBA offer to next year and do 1 year of IMT to see how I feel. Everyone that I spoke with told me that I would regret my choice and that I am romanticising medicine as I haven't been full-time in a long time. \n I want to hear your opinion on that, especially from doctors and consultants who like what they do.

Staff tell me \"He's still at it.\" So I waited about 10 minutes outside of his room. Someone said I should knock and enter. I did not. I spoke with staff outside of his room for the 10 minutes. Then I had to depart for a meeting as I was now running late. He then opened the door to his room as I was about to depart and seemed to want to talk. I couldn't as I was going to be late for the important meeting. I thought there was a funny side but off course said nothing of the sort. I breached no standard of practice as far as I am aware. \n I am unable to reveal other details - and don't ask why.

          "description": "Seems like a lot of people on this subreddit are very pro-CCT and flee, but was curious if most people expressing these views are ST4+? \n Currently an ST1 and training's been alright - it's shielded from a lot of NHS bullshit, but you're still working for the NHS. \n Ophthalmology is switching to a new curriculum next year, but I'm skeptical this will significantly reduce training length. At the moment, I'm anticipating to CCT in probably 7-8 years after all of ST and ?fellowship assuming I stay 100% and pass all my exams/expected competencies in a reasonable time frame. \n I know people have talked about going to Australia or the Middle East, but frankly I'm not that keen on the latter, and if everyone's thinking of going to Australia or Canada after CCT-ing - what is the landscape even going to look like for me when I flee 8 years down the line? 😅 I do predict there will be healthcare shortages, but I would think locally, they'd also be looking to expand medical school/training places to accommodate in the next decade too. Is the prospect of CCT and flee as an ST1 even realistic?\n Also, I know ophthalmology is one of the more lucrative specialties, so surely there must be some barriers in place to emigrating vs a specialty that has a more supportive role (e.g. rads, anaes).\n    submitted by    /u/ophthalmologyornot  \n [link]   [comments]",

They also state because I moved the working weekend I’m not owed a zero day (I moved the weekend before they agreed to give me any zero days at all, so I’d argue if I cancel my swap I need my zero day, then reinstate the swap). Note, the working pattern given above is the original rotation (as if the weekend had not been swapped).

There really is no point trying to predict referrals as I know what to do with most of them anyway, but it’s a compulsion I can’t stop. \n My next rotation will be in a speciality I have little knowledge on, but I will be covering wards AND referrals overnight. I’m scared I’m going to perpetually be a wreck.

I feel like I've forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn't that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don't remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.\n Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO's (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I've been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I've also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I've contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? \n Just for a little more info: I’m starting on gen surg. Also I'm hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I'm honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I'm working a 9-5 office job which I'm looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. \n Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I'm ready to put my best foot forward and I’m honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound.

Initially taking a year out after F1 or F2\n I am also worried on the financial strain this will put on my husband as by the time I am due I will not be entitled to the nhs maternity pay \n I am just wondering if I should just postpone f1 to next year altogether? My due date at the moment is late December/ early Jan so I could technically finish the first rotation \n Fy1 is already hard enough and I’m just worried I will not be able to cope. \n    submitted by    /u/Ktt_bee  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have learnt this the hard way every year so far as a doctor - nobody wants improvement they only want to perpetuate the status quo and crush any challenge to authority or even open discussion. \n The NHS can have its way and just employ under qualified robots to do it’s willing as per the way of the world these days. Maybe outsource healthcare to a call centre in India? Robot consultations as is the way in the USA. \n Anyway - does anyone actually know a tradesperson earning £50-60k/y? I’d rather cut my losses and go back to college despite having postgrad degrees on top of medical training. \n Has anyone successfully started a business like aesthetics or even non medical and made it succeed? \n Is there any hope at all for the profession because I’m not hearing anything positive at all and it feels very much like the government don’t want or need doctors and in the UK the government IS the NHS. And the overseas market for UK doctors is saturated. \n Do any senior doctors actually want to change the system?

She answered questions about my levels of anxiety with completely made up answers even though I am seeing a private therapist for these anxiety problems.\n I said to her on the phone I was not happy with her cavalier attitude regarding my medical records and that this couldn’t be a “mistake” since she knowingly filled my record with bs data. That’s when she said I should stop being condescending towards her…\n I must say I am pretty shocked following this encounter, she apologised for making a “mistake” and that she “understood my frustration” she actually asked me the questions she had taken upon herself to answer in my stead and surprise surprise, her “clinical judgment” was a mile off my actual answers.\n Is this normal/ok?

They also said it was going to be extended 6 weeks however it’s now going to be 3 months as it protects the trust from being accused of unfair dismissal.\n My concerns are has this been extended as they wish to fire me?

          "description": "My MRI is happening next Friday and I understand results can take a while, and mine is just an extra precaution and not as high priority (incidental lesion find at fracture clinic but no -looking aggressive features.) \n From what the appointment letter tells me it sounds like the MRI will go back to the referring doctor, does that mean they’ll arrange an appointment at the fracture clinic I went to originally to discuss?\n Just asking because I live across the street from my fracture clinic but the MRI is further afield.\n Tangent but if no one knows that’s fine: I was a regular blood donor but last request text received, I asked before making an appointment given I’m being screened for this and on the waiting list for another (also precautionary due to recent familial diagnoses, not personal symptoms) and they deferred me for now. \n If after these screenings the doctors say I’m all clear can I just email the Blood Transfusion Services and let them know I can donate again? Or is that like a permanent deferral.\n    submitted by    /u/Delicious-Product968  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I’m currently working in a call centre for a bank and I absolutely despise it. So I’m quite nervous at the thought of this job being similar to my current one. I really don’t want to be stuck on calls all day speaking to people. I don’t enjoy it!!! \n So any input would be appreciated. Would it be like working in a call centre or would it be more relaxed? I’m just so confused and I was excited for the interview but the more I read the job description, my excitement fades.

The support typist role would be an upgrade within my current department and the clinical coding is a complete sidetrack. I'm confident enough in my science to deal with the clinical coding job as I've also done it on the side in my current role. Admin support typists in theory would be a lot more chill but the progression would be gated to gathering experience and then applying for band 4 roles over just progressing naturally from acc to cc and getting a band up.

For the past 4-5 months I’ve had several gp appointments/A&E visits for ongoing chest pain which is getting worse and spreading to other areas (my neck/back/legs). I’ve had the general tests done & an ECG which all came back fine. I’ve been told it is anxiety & there is nothing they can do and I should get counselling. I have been huffed and puffed at and belittled for months by doctors, meanwhile the pain has carried on increasing so much to the point that I can barely get out of bed. I don’t have much quality of life and I spend everyday in tears trying to live with the pain.\n I feel incredibly stuck & frustrated because the NHS will not help me. They keep suggesting I need counselling, but don’t put anything in place for me to gain access to it? I was prescribed diazepam after an A&E visit and it made no difference. Paracetamol and other pain killers have not helped in the slightest either. I had another GP appointment today and my doctor literally sighed at me and told me there is nothing they can do and I should look into psychiatric help, then sent me off home with nothing put in place. Shouldn’t they be the ones arranging that help? I’m at my wits end.\n I’m exhausted from the constant pain & feel helpless because I’m repeatedly being brushed off. I’m willing to believe it’s anxiety as it’s all I hear, but no one’s telling me how to fix it. I don’t feel anxious at all which is what is utterly confusing me, I’m just in a lot of physical pain and it’s unbearable. What can I do in this situation?

          "description": "Hi all!\n I’ve been qualified in the NHS since October 2018 and started as a band 5, I progressed to band 6 within 10 months in August 2019. In August 2022 I left my contracted NHS role and have been on the staff bank as band 6 since, working full time but also taking a few months (max was 2.5) off here and there to travel throughout this period of time. I’m planning to go back to work full time and be contracted in September 2024 and wondering how my pay will be affected. I will have been a band 6 for 5 years come August 2024, so I would be at the top of band 6 pay scale if I had continued working contracted hours, but I’m unsure whether this will be taken into account when I start my new job role or if they will start me at the bottom of band 6. \n Does anyone have any advice regarding this? I know it is likely up to managers discretion, but wondering how likely they are to honour the experience I have when I wasn’t contracted for 2 years out of the 5 as a band 6.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/_7essabean_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m 35 (f) will be 36 at end of this year. I’ve got quite a varied background in terms of career. Teacher for 5 years, then moved to IT project management following a software MSc and stayed for almost 7 years. Recently I’ve been struggling in my PM job with the pressure/hours/internal mismanagement and decided to follow my 18yo self’s dream of working in healthcare and becoming a nurse so I took a job as a HCA in a local trust with a view to studying and working at the same time to become an RN.\n Nearly a month in and I’m miserable. There’s an underlying culture of bullying from management to lower bands and it’s bitchy and there are obvious cliques. The drs and senior nurses are really patronising and often make jokes that I’m the most overqualified HCA they’ve ever had. The pay is horrific (which I knew) and my elderly parents are leaning on me increasingly for financial support. My partner and I are thinking of starting a family soon and as I’m not getting any younger I think it might be wise to return to corporate (not to the same company) for more stability, better wage and more flexibility once we have kids.\n Should I stick it out with healthcare or go back to corporate? My issue was more with the company I worked for as a PM as opposed to the work. I figure that time isn’t on my side in terms of having a family and that’s more important to me than anything right now.

          "description": "Questions: 1. Are SIGN guidelines the equivalent of NICE in Scotland? 2. If so, could anyone direct me to the SIGN guidelines for the treatment of EUPD (I’m struggling to find them). 3. If not, are they generally the same as the NICE guidelines? 4. Any general advice would be appreciated. \n Context: I was “unofficially” diagnosed with EUPD a really long time ago and no one ever told me. I’m contesting it with the CMHT and not being listened to. \n From reading the NICE guidelines, generally my take away was that the patient should be fully informed and involved in their treatment. This didn’t happen with me. When I’ve asked about diagnosis before I’ve only been told “we don’t want to diagnose you, just treat symptoms”. No psychology referrals were ever explained to me. I went to them so I wouldn’t be discharged from services but they were geared towards trauma and consistent emotional dysregulation and it confused me honestly. \n This year however, I’ve been talking very directly about diagnosis and still only receiving deflection. I was treated very obviously for it at a crisis centre but they wouldn’t be honest. I brought it up directly several times saying I don’t agree that I have the condition. I had to make a subject access request to confirm. (I now see the lack of good practice that led to the assumption and it’s pretty shocking). \n The Mental Welfare Commission told me that if I asked about diagnosis I should have been told one of two things: 1. You’re being treated for EUPD 2. We don’t want to disclose your diagnosis to you because it may worsen your condition. They also told me I should have been told one of these anyway unprompted. \n It doesn’t appear that I’ve been treated in accordance with anything, but I’d appreciate some clarity on this? \n Thanks. \n    submitted by    /u/Kilchomanempire  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Bit of a confusing title, but hope someone can offer an opinion?\n I had an usual mole scanned at Boots and uploaded to a consultant dermatologist. I received a call to say it looked benign but has been marked as suspicious due to it's location - removal and biopsy were recommended. GP took it seriously as they also provide this service and reffered me on the two week pathway.\n I was seen a couple of days ago at the hospital and the doctor couldn't have been more judgemental and dismissive of me using the mole scanning service. Despite admitting he'd never heard of it. Accused it of being some AI app that just increases their workload. I was made to feel like a silly time waster before he'd even examined me.\n When he did examine me, he concluded that my mole was very atypical and suspicious and needed an exision biopsy!!!\n Anyway, this will be done in 2-4 weeks. In the meantime I've been reading about The Mole Clinic which appears very reputable and provides a consultation and exision which is then sent for biopsy on the same day.\n OK, perhaps they still not might be to see me within a week and the NHS time-frame isn't really that bad considering, but then up to another 2 weeks for results. It'll be about a 4-6 wait in total.\n However if I get this done privately then I'll effectively be discharging myself from the NHS clinic which feels super risky. Then, if the mole comes back as cancerous, I'll be screwed because I'm assuming I'd have to be re-referred by my GP? I don't think they'd be happy about that, and then would the hospital clinic even take me back as an urgent referral after binning them off?\n It seems like a bad idea, right? I think my anxiety about it is affecting my judgements.\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Long_Ant_6510  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m on a fixed term contract and for whatever reason my initial contract ended on the 28th March and was not extended on ESR till almost the end of this month. This means that I have missed the cut off date for this month’s pay.\n I was told all this was due to delays from execs in signing the business case and several forms that needed approval from different departments such as finance and HR. To me this is non of my fault and have been told that an advance has been submitted but from what I know and what I’ve been told by colleagues is that I will only be paid about half or 60% of the full amount I’m scheduled to get which is a pain.\n I was the advance will be made within 24hrs of payday which is Monday. When questioned whether it is possible to get the full amount or at least confirm the amount I’m getting they seem to deflect both question saying I’ll get it the other amount owed in the my next payslip. Is there any way of me getting the full amount within next week ? \n I’ve just recently moved into an apartment and it requires month in advance and this months rent all together as well as deposit so money is really tight and could do with getting paid the full amount…\n Has anyone had this problem before?

It also takes me away from the lived experience aspect of my current role which is important to me and one of my main skills.

          "description": "I'm a ward clerk that's looking to join a union; not for any pressing matter, just given the political climate in the UK. The big 3 that get mentioned are Unison, Unite and GMB but the thing that's making me hesitate about them is that Unison & Unite seem to list every other hospital profession under the sun specificaly as staff they cater to but ward clerks are lumped into the 'and other admin staff' category; and GMB seems to be workers in general with no specialisation. On one hand I get it, ward clerks are comparatively low in numbers compared to most other hospital roles, but on the other hand I want to know that a union will be looking out for us just as much as they do for the roles with big numbers.\n Open to any advice on which union might be best for ward clerks and if there's any other unions to suggest please do.\n    submitted by    /u/-Twokad-  \n [link]   [comments]",

My GP referred me to them for a PTSD diagnosis, CPA, talking therapies, and medication advice.\n I was taken aback during the latest session when the psychiatrist began really pushing me to look at going privately for talking therapies.\n I get that the NHS is crumbling - I work in the same NHS Trust - but it felt really wrong to me that an NHS professional should advocate for going against the founding principles of the NHS.\n Does anyone else feel that this is unethical?\n —\n Extra information: I have the distinct impression that the recovery service really doesn’t want to take me on because I need significant reasonable adjustments to their usual ways of working. My autism and ADHD impact my presentation of mental health symptoms, and I need lots of additional time to process emotions and information. The local IAPT straight up rejected me as ‘too complex,’ and told my GP to send me to recovery.

There’s been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I’ve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn’t use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I’m not even sure if I’m going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I’m really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the “usual surgery risks” (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). \n I’ve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don’t have have savings as they’ve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can’t tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement.

He sexually assaulted me. I didn't report it, so no official complaint is logged.\n He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.\n Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.\n I soon moved because I didn't want to be anywhere near him.\n He's contacted friends asking where I am.\n My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex's part of the hospital. My relative's mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.\n My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn't understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.\n My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he'd be far enough away and chances low.\n Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.\n More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.\n My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.\n I don't know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.\n Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen?

          "description": "Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks' time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.\n Near the top of the letter is a phone number to 'reschedule or cancel'. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to 'reschedule or cancel', it seems reasonable that if I don't contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there's a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.\n I wasn't sure what to do, so I figured I'd ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven't been able to get through to anyone.\n So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I'm unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?\n I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I've been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I'm terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.\n Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).\n Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.\n    submitted by    /u/permabearish  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, for a few years I've been having recurring abdominal pain, which seems to be chronic gastritis as I have all the symptoms.\n I first brought this up to my GP in 2022, which resulted in me taking prescribed omeprazole for 3 months. After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what's causing my stomach pain.\n Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were \"inconclusive.\" I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.\n This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.\n This has been going on for years and I'm frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements. What can I do??? \n    submitted by    /u/cheappapayasoap  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently downloaded the NHS app & it shows which medication I am on, but it's not showing my medical condition! Which I've had since birth, it's not showing on the NHS app! I've been at my current doctors for 5 years & they're aware of my medical history. It says medical Condition 0. \n I asked my doctors & they asked me to put it in writing which I did.

          "description": "TW for mention of death. \n I apologise for asking such a blunt question, but I’ve always wondered about this and wondered if anyone can inform me. \n I always think about the paramedic who informed me that my Mum had passed away, many years ago. She died in a very upsetting and traumatic way, and from what I understand, the visual would have been really upsetting. I did not see her. \n I always think of him and I wonder what kind of support he would have been given. Is there an official process? Is there mandatory counselling given after incidents like this? \n Thank you in advance, and apologies for the morbid question. \n    submitted by    /u/faeriesandfoxes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a medical exemption card. When I went to get a prescription earlier, they said ‘and you have a pre-paid certificate right?’ And I said ‘no I have a medical exemption’ and they looked puzzled and said they have me down as pre-paid certificate. I showed my card, they then entered the correct type and all was fine. \n What has now worried me is I’ve collected prescriptions a couple of times from here previously, one last week and one in January. I’m pretty sure I showed my card then or said I had a medical exemption. Any chance they wrote down the wrong type at one point and now that’s stored on my file? Could I get penalised by the NHS BSA if it looks like l’ve claimed on this when I haven’t? Maybe they’d see if I have a medical exemption and it’d be ok, but not sure how their checking system works. \n I will go into the pharmacy tomorrow just to check with them, but thought I’d ask on here as it’s causing a little anxiety.
