The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. \n“The new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. “The new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.”\nWHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S.  \nVaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.  \nThere were 473 000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",

You get relocation money plus a very good pension scheme 401k etc \n \nCopays - As patients pay directly towards your consultation they have much more respect for you and your time. Also they will try self care, pharmacy etc etc. They also know it's easy for a Dr to code their visit in such a way their bill will be jacked up to the max (level 4 consult) so they know it's in their interests to be polite to you. Patients know full well things cost and are less demanding as a result \n \nStaffing - much better support staff here who do obs before you see the patient and also handle the paperwork\n \nPatient numbers - I only see max 18 a day and that is rare. Get 40 mins - 1hr for physical and new patients and 20 mins for follow ups\n \n Disadvantage\n I would say main one is hassle with insurance companies but our support staff deal with that a lot and take away the burden. \n    submitted by    /u/fred66a  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I wrote 'see full medical records\n This was then queried, so i said can attach full medical record if the patient consents.\n But I feel this might have been the wrong advice. A) don't think should really be providing full medical records to insurance companies unless patients really request it B) think if so, would need to go through the notes and redact any 3rd party info. \n I'm not sure how to rectify this situation. It was only a few days ago - so i will ask team not to contact pt/release any info. And I can suggest that the form needs repeating.\n But I'm not sure how to complete the form.

I'm not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation.

No pharma company involved.\n Whilst Bianchi is a superior reoair, standard NHS bunion repair = Invasive procedure using a purchased medical device (screw).\n Example 2:\n Inguinal hernia repair\n Desarda technique = A strip of external oblique is stitched to inguinal ligaments and internal oblique. Wonderful natural muscle graft. \n Whilst desarda is superior, NHS repair = A piece of purchased polypropylene stitched into your abdominal wall. YUCK\n Example 3\n Heart stents = Research shows that the vast majority of operations brought no benefit in stable patients. But the surgeries were arguable performed due to the stents being a medical product was being pushed and purchased. \n Example 4\n Fasting. \n The health benefits are endless. Reverse insulin resistance, autophagy etc etc\n Fasting doesn’t involve any prescriptions, so doesn’t seem to be recommended.\n How many GP’s/consultants prescribe a 10 day fast?\n \n I can go private and see doctors with views that differ from the masses.

I’ve had only one primary case placement in my training so far, which was an honest nightmare (only enjoyable bit was the patient consultations, I used to dread interacting with the team- they were rude, easily irritable and honestly seemed like not coping with the workload themself which kinda was being taken out on trainees). I was at a point where I questioning my decision to be in GP training. Thanks to the weekly teaching group sessions at the time, I could understand that experience can vary greatly between practices and therefore decided it would be sensible to stay on to see how things go in my next primary care rotation.

And has an old car as well that she uses for work. As well as student loan repayments etc. \n I don’t really know how much she earns, but she says that this GP trainee position will probably pay as much as the FY2 because in FY2 she had long days and nights of work and overtime etc.\n Is this really the case that a doctor training to be a GP in London is this skint? Or can just get by without saving much?? \n Would appreciate your input since I’m not a doctor and not in medical field either. \n EDIT - I have already googled but want to know if the net pay is so low that it’s only a tiny bit more than FY2 because it’s only 9 to 5.

I like it a lot and gradually growing on me even though in the first week I had marked myself as bad at anaesthetics when it is just a specialty with a very steep learning curve and it’s difficult to be bad at Anaesthetics as F2 because the expectations are literally on the floor (even CT1s who I look at like seniors are treated much the same) and they seem way too impressed that I even read about physiology and pharmacology to better understand what I am seeing. And they’re all nice people (except a few). I like to get stuck in with cannulas but a lot of the time they seem to want to do it themselves so not getting as much practice as I was hoping but I have gotten better at least even if I am not the cannula god yet so can’t complain. Best FY job so far \n I have ICU next where I am supernumerary and people say I will get to do more stuff there so looking forward to ICU. Always a consultant present and they want you to run everything by them so it looks like I will have fun there\n But I haven’t had the opportunity to do any US guided cannulas, arterial lines (have seen them being put in), or other procedures so far as art lines anaesthetists want to do themselves because we only get one go at it in theatre. If the anaesthetist is requiring US then they’re definitely not gonna let me even come close to having a go so I just watch. I was wanting to be very good at cannulation including US guided but doesn’t look like I will be excellent by the end of anaesthetics even if substantial improvement\n Will I get more cannulation opportunities in ICU (very useful skill to have)? Or will it mainly be art lines, central lines etc in ICU which I may not be doing much outside of ICU?\n    submitted by    /u/Samosa_Connoisseur  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've picked up a few complex housebound patients by virtue of being the trainee who is first in line for a visit, sent one of them in today in an ambulance ?MSCC, (less of a ? And more of a \"I'll eat my stethoscope if its not\") It was a difficult visit due to the fact I know him and his wife very well, they're struggling already, and this was a shock. Few other complex medical bits today and just a standard non stop GP day for the rest. \n As a result I've woken up almost every hour since I fell asleep having had very vivid work realted dreams, always interesting to see what weird and suprisingly medically accurate scenarios my subconscious can come up with. I had a really nice evening, chatted to some friends/family, made a nice dinner, played with the dog, thought I'd decompressed fairly well but obviously not! Does anyone have any tips on how to switch their brain off from days like this before going to sleep?\n    submitted by    /u/Melon-Me  \n [link]   [comments]",

The longer this goes on, the more time they have to push their agenda which we all know too well. I understand the BMA is trying to be pragmatic about the timeframe for restoration etc. but the cold, hard truth is that this government most certainly can afford to pay us in full.

I’ve just returned from sick leave for a flare of a long term chronic health condition which has been classified by occupational health as a disability and with protections under the Equality Act. Occupational health have recommended some reasonable adjustments to return to work - namely coming off of on calls for six months and a phased return over 8 weeks. I’m wondering if anyone can advise how this might affect pay and whether pay is protected at the same level as before I went on sick leave during this phased return, as it is a temporary change/reasonable adjustment? I’ve heard varying things from the trust I work at, and would be in a difficult position if my pay were to be cut especially as my employer will not let me work full time or do on calls currently. I’ve contacted the BMA and I’m waiting to hear back. I’m just wondering if there are any resources that I can refer to before contacting HR?

Should I move to the states for internal medicine and then cardio > 600k minimum in around 6-7years. ?\n All that aside - my question is, is it even that important? Im a current F1 and ive made 60k this year pre-tax. I live a pretty good life. I actually want to do surgery but would give that up if i moved to the States. \n Ive spoke to a friend of mine who is ST6 in surgical sub-speciality (not gensurg/neurosurgey type) and he says you can comfortable clear 6 figures in reg years by locuming - especially if NROC. Which then rises to around 200-220k as a consultant with NHS + PP. \n My question is basically:\n  \nHow important is money beyond 100-150k (my partner is also a doctor so x1.5-1.6 as she will go LTFT). \n \nWould any surgeons here give up surgery to make 3x the money in a procedural speciality in the states. \n \nI have all my family here - both parents are doctors and dad is 70% private in a high earning speciality clearing around 350. Add all that together and I am naturally very privileged and its great having family near by. Is it worth giving all the family support and all that comes with it for an extra couple 100 thousand a year. \n \nI also just a bought a house, I dont know if this would tie any of yous down but I dont think this is a limiting factor. \n I understand this may come of like me being boastful but I genuinely am very confused. To be honest i struggle to sleep at night thinking about this decision. I sometimes wish I just flunked the steps so that this wouldn't have to be a decision i needed to make.\n \n My current plan is to apply for: IM (US), CST (Uk) and Plastics (US) \n For anyone familiar with the US, my stats are:\n Step 1: P (1st attempt)\n Step 2: 267\n Publications 10\n 2 months of US Clinical Experience.\n Would really appreciate the advice of anyone - sorry if this came off in a bad way.\n    submitted by    /u/Signal_Read_6050  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not only is this situation mortifying, but it's also becoming a topic of discussion among my colleagues.\n I've tried to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, considering dietary habits, stress levels, and even possible gastrointestinal issues, but to no avail. It's as if the elevator itself triggers this bizarre auditory association.\n I turn to you, my esteemed peers, for any insights or advice you may have on how to address this peculiar predicament.

Having just been through a routine terrible induction following (another) rotation to a different trust I have accidentally become involved in improving the process. \n This trust emails >15 documents for you to review and still requires a printed and signed 'checklist' to state you have accessed the relevant materials for induction.\n My plan is to streamline this into a website hosting it all and a Microsoft form checkbox to state you have reviewed and are happy with the information provided.\n The current checklist forms are overly long and onerous. A cursory Google has not shown me anything definitive for what trusts base these forms on? Is it just individual trust departments deciding what is essential to include to indemnify the trust?\n In terms of gold standard guidance for induction I am aware the BMA has some guidance (https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/career-progression/training/induction-for-junior-doctors) but again wondered if there was anything more contractually binding to what trusts should be doing for induction?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Forjak89  \n [link]   [comments]",

In conculsion legalisation protocols between UK government and EU parliment are held of more value than patient safety I guess! I have got nothing against EU graduates but this is injust for every other IMG and UK graduate that have to sit this exam. Also the competency level of communicational and practical aspects of medicine from EU graduates seems to be lacking due to the profound levels of so called 'Taught in English' programmes in some countries where in reality it is far from taught in english and ideally require the original language to have a just of clinical years. Also I really don't understand how the UK government is just accepting what the EU is telling them to accept with no refute whatsoever, I suppose brexit but seriously.\n May come as a hate post for EU graduates but I sincerely don't mean it in that way, also this post is just of conception and I am not keen on making this my identity of having to introduce the ukmla for EU graduates lmao.

For reference I’m quite a small female on an all male ward and the environment is very noisy and quite a few of the patients are very disinhibited and intimidating. A member of staff was assaulted a few weeks ago and I generally just don’t feel safe despite all the alarms and other safety measures in place. \n I thought i would feel more comfortable by this point but I’m not sure I can hack another 3 months with my stress levels this high. \n Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Or know any strategies that could help? Or worse case has anyone managed to switch up rotations (unlikely I know!)? \n    submitted by    /u/Odd_Acanthaceae347  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm also keen that these things should be free as it's expensive enough getting into specialty training. \n I'm thinking of building an e-learning course with some virtual face to face content (to meet the criteria of CST applications, but also to discuss project ideas and get feedback).

The team at Mind the Bleep is made of over 200 doctors now - so plenty of people to provide expertise. \n The content I'm thinking to cover would include - Briefly educational theory with a focus on what matters in the real world - Overview and practicalities of how to set up/organise or run the different types of medical education (bedside, tutorial and small group teaching, lectures, simulation, webinars, e-learning courses & websites) including curriculum, assessment, feedback & teaching methods \n I'd love some advice.

That doesn't mean it won't help & CPD accreditation doesn't appear to be necessary on any portfolio - Utility of this programme as I really want to create something that is useful to people teaching.

I would prep the list days in advance, get to the hospital early just to find out that another newly CCT-ed consultant just did a ‘surprise pikachu’ and will be joining the list. \n Of course they don’t just ‘join’ per se, more like do the entire list with the consultant. My poor senior reg only got to put in the ports and did a bit of bowel manipulation. Needless to say, I didn’t get to do very much. \n When will I actually learn?!? What should I do?

We get coffee shouted for us every single morning and sometimes we even get it twice.\n I take home roughly £3.4k a month and every second day someone gets sent home early. I got £1.25k for professional development, aka I bought a new phone.\n Things over there seem worse than when I left. Stop staying just for family, you barely see them and might get whisked off to any part of the country at a moments notice, I have 6 week of leave I can take in a chunk to see family etc. I have full autonomy over my specialties and career here, I even changed last minute because I heard one I was intending to do was shit basically.\n I genuinely love my job, sometimes I even stay a bit later (get paid for it) for the banter. I work roughly 2 on call shifts a month and have 0 nights this year. Everyday I wake up and it's 20+ degrees, there's not a cloud in the sky.

I know a lot of this will be dependent on my personal circumstances but if anyone has any experiences of following either path and can offer reassurance/caution then it would be most appreciated! \n I am an EM ST3 runthrough trainee struggling with mental health secondary to work and have therefore lost passion for it which I did have at the beginning of ST3. I like EM and want to continue working in it in the future. Plan to finish ST3 but a bit stuck about what to do after this. Current state of burnout/depression is likely a long term build up with a couple of specific incidences that put me over the edge. \n Options as I see it are to continue training dropping down to LTFT and trying to push for some sort of career break (which i've been told is unlikely given i wouldn't do something clinical). As a run through trainee, knowing it would be hard to get back as an ST4 in my region if I left, this seems like a sensible option but the thought of continuing training doesn't do anything for my sense of apathy/low mood. \n Or drop my number and locum (i am financially dependent on work and don't have an option to not work) with a plan to trust grade/CESR in the future. The idea of a break and having some control over things makes me feel great but I'm nervous about the uncertainty/isntability this introduces going forward with my career. \n I am doing everything i feel is needed to address mental health (counselling/occy health) and my department are aware of these issues/have offered time off if i feel like this is what i need. \n Thanks in advance (on nights sorry if i don't reply to people quickly) \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/LiveMiddle7891  \n [link]   [comments]",

Practically i can be able to differentiate traffic signal/ sometimes i get confused between Red/Green/Orange/yellow. \n I can identify the standard colours, when the shades vary, like dark green - i say brown. Light green- that’s yellow to me. ( the cheese and onion Lays - crisp i’m still confused whether it’s yellow or Green, you can google it. i hope, you must have guessed my country now!! )\n This is my very first post in Reddit, i eventually will inform the GMC during my GMC registration. I felt whenever we say inform DVLA to patients ( well, OSCE scenario ) that hurts me, because in my back of the mind, i wanted to avoid this to GMC. But not anymore, I decided to inform them! \n It’s not my fault having a faulty glorious X gene! \n The purpose of this post is, if any fellow colleague/ if anyone knew anyone who has mentioned about CB during the GMC registration, i want to know how they proceed? Any tests? Any precaution!\n During my MBBS and Post-graduation in back home, i had to undergo a special screening in ophthalmology which was fun! I’m eager to know what the GMC do, usually!!\n Thank you. Looking forward for everyone’s inputs!\n PS: my speciality of interest is Internal Medicine, Cardiology!! \n And i couldn’t edit the wrong spelling for the word Colour above! Apologies-:) for those who got hurt for the wrong spelling, even my eyes hurt when i see a wrong spelling!

Instead told me they are putting this patient on the medical list. When I explained that this might not be safe/ appropriate. They got angry and insisted they were the consultant and I'm the reg so I must listen. They won't engage with me and only wanted to speak to my consultant.\n My consultant also said the same thing as I did.\n Patient was completely fine. all bloods/ ecg/ xray normal. patient got sent to the ambulatory services (I asked nurse to refer to the ambulatory service) and eventually discharged.\n the ED consultant has written an email to my supervisor stating my 'rudness was a serious matter' and that he wants to be kept updated as this is something he feels he should refer to the GMC - not verbatim because I can't remember the details of the email.\n I'm confused about this reaction. a little worried about the potential GMC complaint.

          "description": "Another post by an IMG wanting to use the U.K. speciality training programme and leave. Half the IMGs I talk to, especially GPs, state the same. \n It is truly infuriating to see when countless home grads are being completely fucked. Unable to secure a training space, because we have a system that shows no favour to home graduates. Who typically are less likely to move post CCT than IMG counterparts. \n This issue is just getting worse. How are fresh graduates expected to compete with those that have had numerous years collecting points for self assessment scores and examination prep from abroad?\n Even if the government tripled the training places overnight. It does not fix this problem. \n The RMLT is dead. However we need a new system. This is going to lead to hundreds if not thousands unemployed after F2.

You wished that you would have a consultant or SpR who was a tiny bit interested in training and that they would let you do it.

Other than this incident feedback seemed to relate to how I come across rather than any specific incident. \n The stupid decision in question was some time ago and my ES seemed relieved at how much I'd reflected on it immediately after and since and my ownership of my mistake. Said just not to make it a pattern and all should be ok. I am accepting of feedback and strive to improve. \n Generally in life I am someone who can just make stupid mistakes in a variety of settings \"in the moment\" and regret them intensely after. I have been humbled by this and other dicey anaesthetic experiences (where there was no question at all that I had acted completely appropriately). I believe I am good at recognising risk before and after things and will counsel patients appropriately, ask for senior help at the first whiff of risk. What I'm looking for is advice on how to be better at making good clinical decisions in the moment and intuitively minimising risk, a quality I want to work on. Any advice would be much appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/ConsultantSecretary  \n [link]   [comments]",

I took the cascard and looked at triage notes which said patient had taken X painkiller 2 hours ago and is allergic to Y and Z pain killers. I said, that limits my options as to what I can give. My colleague, who is more experienced, said prescribe C painkiller. I asked the nurse if the patient was allergic to it or if there were any contraindications, nurse said no. I prescribed it and asked her to double check with patient before giving it. (I did not know the allergy box on the cascard was not signed). \n I finished my shift and went home. Later that day the sho that was with me called me to inform me that the patient had stridor after the medication was given and became unconscious. Medical team were called who gave her adrenaline and prophylactic intubation and ITU. The patient’s vitals were normal throughout. The patient’s partner was called who said the same incident happened to her with the same medication a few months prior. An incident form was filled out. \n The next day the patient was extubated. Imaging normal and she self discharged. \n The nurses are saying that they informed the patient of the name of the medication before giving it to her and she accepted it (have not witnessed this myself though)\n I’m glad the patient is alive and well and I’ve spent many days going over what I should and should not have done and how I could have prevented this. Currently I’m extremely worried about what could happen and what the investigation can lead to. \n No one has emailed me yet about the incident report. Should I add it to form r\n Can anyone please advise.\n Thank you \n    submitted by    /u/Anxious_Bid2471  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have tried in the past to challenge this practice as I believe that the main treatment for the stable rapid AF in the ED is rate control and try to search for the underlying cause, and I would only administer IV fluids if the patient is septic or dehydrated, otherwise, I don't see any benefit from overloading a possibly tired heart with more load to deal with in a euvolemic patient. Unfortunately I have always been put down when I tried asking about how IV fluids alone would benefit these patients. I am not sure on the validity of this practice snd I thought I might be on the wrong side so I have tried to seek its justification but couldn't find sufficient evidence.

I didn't get into IMT last year so decided to do GP and re apply.\n I have an offer. I'm considering switching to IMT.\n I have a group 2 speciality in mind (oncology).\n Except... have zero experience in it (currently trying to get taster).\n So, I don't know if I'll love it. It sounds fascinating to me otherwise and the job otherwise seems great.\n There are other specialities I like (gastro, resp) but the jobs are intense and I don't know how much reserve I have left. I want more work life.\n I've thought about clinical genetics or chemical pathology which you can enter after GPST3. No experience in it either. But it's 9-5, and not GP.\n Other times I think maybe I should do something like anaesthetics or interventional radiology. Very procedural, much less fluff.\n My options are, do IMT 1&2 at 70% LTFT over 3 years to give time to finish full MRCP / PACES.\n Or, finish 2 more years of GP and do 2 years of IMT full time, and do MRCP / PACES in 4 years time, and maybe get some papers under my belt (or switch to a different speciality... I could prepare for that).\n I just worry that with every year, the competition ratios seem to go up exponentially, what if there's no chance in 2 years...\n My head hurts.\n    submitted by    /u/Evening-Row-1798  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What?\n We need to take action against the General Medical Council and their anti-doctor agenda. By endorsing MAP expansion, they are undermining the medical profession and risking patient safety. However, unregistered medical practice is illegal, and unless the BMA coordinates a campaign, we must continue to pay GMC registration fees. \n The GMC encourages doctors to pay registration fees by direct debit. Direct debits have the lowest admin burden for the GMC and low transaction fees. \n Essentially, if you pay via direct debit, the GMC keeps more of your money and has to spend less on processing the payment.\n However, the GMC allows you to pay your registration fee by other methods:\n  \nCredit/debit card\n Cheque\n Postal order\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6niyr3k8zxc1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=7041dc4cf411d8967c4901c072371d9f1af2b7c4\n So what?\n These other payment methods will cost the GMC more to process and administer. \n Card payments are associated with higher payment processing fees. Cheques and postal orders will require more administrative staff to manage and process them.\n Mass cancellation of direct debits would send a message to GMC management, and may force them to acknowledge the strength of feeling amongst the medical profession.\n However, you would need to remember to pay via these other methods - one advantage of direct debits is that they are automated.\n Now what?\n We're open to any suggestions you have about this idea. This would require a coordinated campaign to raise awareness and encourage doctors to switch their GMC payment method.\n We have considered alternative options, but withholding GMC fees is only feasible if the BMA backs a campaign and provides protection for doctors. The GMC removes doctors who do not pay fees from the medical register, so you won't be able to work. They'll also inform the police if you continue to practise medicine!\n DefundtheGMC\n    submitted by    /u/defundthegmc  \n [link]   [comments]",

My girlfriend whom I’ve met at uni is just completing her first Foundation Year down in England.

We both have EU passports if that is of any help. \n I am completely new to this, and that is why I have a lot of questions.

What are the requirements? Do you have to complete Medical core training first? Can you pick the place you want to do your specialty training or are you allocated to it randomly? Can you start your specialty training in one city and finish it in a different one? Should you go into specialty training straight after finishing FYP or is it better to gain some experience working first? \n Working abroad:\n What are common destinations for medics to work abroad, having finished medicine in UK? Where in EU is it possible for UK doctors to work? If you want to complete specialty training in EU or move forward with your medical career, do you have to speak the national language, or are there countries where you will just be fine with English?

I unfortunately didn't get the region/group that I wanted within my deanery, but had been coming to terms with this (my partner and friends all got their top choice region).\n Whilst contacting one of the trust administrators for a different issue, they advised me that one of my rotations within my FY1 year has changed (to a less desired one for me), and also that my job is a GP LIFT programme, where I will have to work a day a week in a local GP practice.\n The LIFT aspect wasn't advertised anywhere in the ranking process or individual job description; when I told them this, they told me that the individual programme code (being FPP instead of the standard code) indicated this despite it not being mentioned that this was the case anywhere, nor was there any other evidence of this elsewhere. \n I don't particularly want to do the LIFT aspect and would much rather do the normal programme as it was advertised to me. Overall the randomised job allocation process has affected me quite negatively and now this is just another aspect which feels completely out of my control. \n I've contacted the BMA about this but they advised me that my trust is acting as mandated per my deanery, and that because the deanery is not directly an NHS employer they are not obligated by law to engage with the BMA; therefore the BMA cannot help me with this. \n Is there anything I can do about this? If so, how should I go about doing it? Any advice would be much appreciated as I've found this whole process quite overwhelming and I'm not sure where to go from here.

I understand how this may be realistic for approaching the end of F1 but I feel I’ve drawn the short straw having never seen medical patients independently until now. So I spend the whole day doubting my decisions and when I get home I’m usually tearful or just numb. I don’t have any friends or colleagues in F1 to talk to I am so alone. \n As F2 approaches I do not feel ready - part of me is relieved at my ARCP likely being extended due to illness and not meeting portfolio requirements. I think about alternative careers every single day as I have not enjoyed one day of F1. But I feel like a failure contemplating leaving what I’ve worked so long for. It’s to the point where I’m having frequent passive thoughts of ending my own life.\n I’ve had advice to continue and pursue a career in psychiatry - which I am interested in but the thought of another year of hospital medicine is daunting. \n Has anyone felt like this and kept going? Any experience with mental health and ARCP being extended? Should I leave now? Any other advice at all would be appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/Throwaway_84856  \n [link]   [comments]",

So from 2008 to 2024, an MP's salary increased by 49.9%; for JDs, from 2008 to 2023, the percentage change in salary was 14.59%.\n Now I know that a part of it is a supply and demand issue. You cannot bring MPs from outside the UK, but you can bring doctors from outside the UK. Obviously, all professions cannot get the same salary rise, but can any Econ nerds out there explain\n 1) What other factors led to the consistent rise in the MP salary?\n 2) I would have thought that the MPs, being a public service profession, the same pay review body reviews the pay and therefore should've been closer to the doctors pay? Is that not the case or does the MP profession have a higher shortage?\n 3) Can there be a new post called MP associate to reduce the number of MPs and therefore cut down the taxpayer spending on MP salary?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/martian-nomad  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got a message the day after saying:\n  \nApplication Status changed to \"Shortlist unsuccessful\" from \"Longlisted\".\n  \nToday I've received an email saying:\n  \nwe are now pleased to let you know that you invited to attend ST1 O&G interviews on either 23rd or 24th May\n  \n(yes they missed some words there)\n It's from Oriel so I know the message is not a scam but I know Oriel can be a bit weird/poorly managed so is this actually legit, i.e. something that can happen? My dashboard still says \"Shortlist unsuccessful\" though.\n Trying to hold off being prematurely happy because I don't want to be disappointed! And what could have led to this change? I got a score of 521 if that helps.\n Thank you for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/RC211V  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd really love any fun stories and advice and just to know if it ever gets better.\n I feel like I'm missing out on so much by working here. I can't go to friends weddings (even after submitting leave requests 6 months in advance) due to staffing. Can't get study leave for a course for the same reasons even after a request for cover from my ES. The rota coordinator and everyone else I need to interact with on an admin side either feels incompetent or malicious. It just feels like everything I try to do gets denied and there's no point in even trying anymore, they might as well allocate my leave for me. I genuinely don't know what they get paid for other than saying computer says no.\n I don't have a job lined up for next year, didn't want to have to go straight into specialty training but don't think I would've got in anyway. Every med ed post or JCF that I've applied to I've been rejected from without even a chance at interview because so many people with MRCP/MRCS are applying.\n I genuinely love being a doctor when I get to do my job and I don't even care about the pay anymore. I just want to feel the tiniest bit valued or respected instead of used and abused. I can't leave the country or move easily as I have a partner that is stuck in their job for the next 2 years and I just don't know where the light at the end of the tunnel is.\n Is there any way that I've missed to try to get my leave approved?

Surely it can’t be good to have brain abscesses and bleeds waiting for hours and hours when they’re Cat 1 cases? \n Is it that there’s no funding for more consultant posts or are the current consultants ladder pulling because there’s so little private work to corner?

I am a medic applying for a group 1 specialty and would like to go LTFT (80%) for specialty training for mental health reasons. \n Without going into too much detail, I have done all of my training so far full time, but the last couple of years of IMT were a real struggle and whilst I managed to finish without any sick leave, I was very close to not being alive at multiple points. My IMT TPD was not really aware of any of this - there were some wellbeing concerns raised at one point but they were put down to other issues, and I think most colleagues would be very surprised if they found out about my diagnosis (and just to be very clear, there have never been any concerns about me clinically and my MSFs/WPBAs have always been very good). I am doing better now and have good support in place, however, because of how bad things got during IMT, and because the nature of my illness means I am likely to get unwell again, I really want to work LTFT in order to try and have some breathing space should things start to go south again. \n My question is, how much of the above should I disclose to my TPD when discussing my LTFT application? Should I tell them my diagnosis and how bad things got? I really want to make the most of HST because I missed out on loads of opportunities during IMT because of my mental health, and if there is support they can give such as allowing me to go LTFT, I really want to make the most of it, but equally, I don't want people to be prejudiced because of my diagnosis. Or even worse, not believing me because I have managed to work full time so far (I can provide evidence of my issues though as I have letter from Practitioner Health etc.). \n I would be grateful for some advice regarding this from anyone who has been through something similar (or from anyone consultants who have been on the other end). \n    submitted by    /u/Tasty_Discipline_102  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Well…can’t believe I am now posting vents on this sub…but here it goes, I’m an IMT, out following the outreach reg reviewing patients. There was a patient who was referred to us on non-rebreath and in deteriorating T1RF. The bay only had 1 oximetry. The nurse assistant was doing her obs round at the time. While I was reviewing the patient with the reg, I asked the NA if I can borrow the machine. The NA told me to get my hands off the machine and I am not allowed to use the machine. At the moment, I couldn’t be asked to care about what she was saying. So I apologised to her and explained that this was a critically unwell patient (no pun intended). Then I took the machine to attend the patient. After our review, the charge nurse had a go at me… essentially chastising me for being condescending to the NA. She also threatened to notify my ES. After years of service in the NHS, passing exams, playing the portfolio game, it frustrates me to say this…but I dislike where we are as modern day doctors. \n    submitted by    /u/StrongPassion3366  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Earlier on in medical school, a completely false allegation was made against me to the police of impropriety. I was voluntarily interviewed under caution. A while later the investigation was closed with no further action, I was never arrested or charged.\n I'm now in the process of applying for registration with the GMC, and found out this is something I'm obliged to disclose to them. I am seeking legal advice.\n I hadn't considered this incident in a while. In hindsight, I feel as if the university didn't properly investigate me, I just got a few offers of support and nothing really ever came of my disclosure. This was an extremely stressful time of my life, I was just happy at the time that the university were not hounding me. I'm now concerned that I didn't contact exactly the right people or inform them of precisely the right things. I'm worried that this will result in me being withheld registration so that I can be investigated.\n I informed my university of the fact that I was the subject of a police investigation and was to be interviewed at the time. I did this via my tutor and university welfare team, and clearly stated I was a medical student, I have evidence of this. However, I didn't specify what I was being accused of, and was never asked. I have some limited evidence that I informed my tutor that I was specifically being interviewed under caution, but it's not airtight.\n I was just hoping for people's views on: 1) If I should have been more explicit/ done anything differently informing my university at the time and 2) how likely I am to be withheld registration.\n Thank you for your opinions in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/aioetiapnwfaa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm very grateful to get into training, especially considering the tight competition for SHO posts.\n However, even though I've accepted the post, I'm still considering moving to Australia. Since I'm from Asia, Australia is definitely closer than the UK, making it easier to travel home for emergencies.\n The only thing holding me back is the requirement to work in a non-training post for over a year before applying for Australian training programs, as I understand PR is necessary. Additionally, I'm unsure about the competitiveness of getting into GP or IMT in Australia.\n Therefore, I'm debating whether to commit to the GP training program for the next three years until CCT before moving to Australia.\n I'd love to hear from people who have recently moved to Australia post-CCT or after FY2 for their insights. Thank you very much!\n Edit for additional info:\n The reason I chose GP training here in the UK is because it was the shortest route to CCT. But I'm actually unsure if I want to become a GP.

          "description": "I'm a junior trainee in ICU right now. I've had some wellbeing issues raised from others (mainly they can see my mood is low/I catastrophise when anything goes wrong or I feel like I've done a bad job). They've spoke to my supervisor who has spoken to me and I'm going through CBT for this and regularly checking in with my supervisor who has been very supportive. \n I found out from my supervisor (they knew this already but didn't mention anything till I mentioned the issues, think they were waiting till I was in a better headspace maybe) one senior trainee raised patient safety concerns. My supervisor agreed I should speak to the senior trainee to get a better idea of what happened. I think these were mainly related to a couple procedures a month or two ago in which they asked if they could take over as I'd tried for a while and things weren't working - I said I wanted the usual one more go for around maybe a minute or so then accepted defeat. The main reason I was hesitant was I didn't want to look incapable and handing it over meant that would go down as a failure. No harm came to the patients as far as I know anyway. I spoke to the senior trainee today but they just said I should speak again to my supervisor and said their main focus was patient safety. Made me feel like crap for sure as I'd hate to be unsafe and always have this fear. Prior to this never had any issues like this raised.\n I'll speak to my supervisor again and see about more details. I'm wondering if anyone has advice about managing this, how to get over this feeling of worry and I guess that concern about feeling safe- there doesn't seem to be any concern from my supervisor and I'm still on rota working independently etc if this makes a difference.

          "description": "The way medicine is headed in the UK currently, with increasing numbers of med school placements and worsening training bottlenecks, more and more of us are going to end up having to work a few years in JCF/SCF roles before entering into training. \n In England, this means that we have to take a knock in our salary to enter training, which I think is kind of ridiculous. Clinical experience (no matter what specialty) makes us better clinicians and more well-rounded doctors, and I don't think anyone should be penalized for that. It's wild to me that if a consultant decides to retrain in another specialty, they have to drop down to an ST1 salary. There is no other career that requires its professionals to decrease their salaries in order to train. \n Is pay protection something we should be pushing for? Is the BMA looking into this?

          "description": "I’m a final-year medical student, starting F1 in August. In my last few weeks of placement, I’ve started wearing a bit of makeup in the hospital. \n When I say makeup, I just mean some basic foundation, mascara, bit of blush, bit of eyeshadow, nothing particularly striking. Basically what I would put on if I was going out for a meal with friends or maybe an informal date. However, what has been striking is the very noticeable difference in how I’m treated. I’m always keen and try to be enthusiastic, so normally after a couple of days of turning up for things the docs will be relatively nice and friendly to me, but it’s definitely only after ‘proving’ myself. Totally fair enough, they get lots of med students passing through. By contrast, I feel like I’ve been treated better and felt welcomed from the get-go. Not many concrete differences that I could point to, mainly just warmer tone and body language, although one of the docs even offered to talk me through a procedure rather than me having to ask. \n Now, I’d love to believe that everyone is just a bit nicer here, but realistically I know I look prettier with a bit of makeup and let’s be honest, pretty privilege is real and it seems like it’s at least a contributing factor to being treated differently. Anyone else experienced this whilst working? I know it varies significantly from team to team as so whether most people wear makeup or not - what’s the standard practice in your department? \n I don’t really desire to wear makeup every day but if it means I’m likely to be treated that much better as an F1 then I think I’ll have to…\n    submitted by    /u/LilacPuddle  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got advice about contacting the BMA but they weren't helpful at all so I gave up. My trust referred the consultant to the GMC and I reported him to the police. I don't want to doxx myself but the police enquiry wasn't successful for a variety of reasons I can't go into.\n The investigation with the GMC was very thorough and they took multiple statements from me. It was extremely scary going to the hearing (I gave evidence both virtually and in person) but the tribunal members were very respectful. They did ask some inappropriate questions but they just needed to clarify I did not behave in a way that warranted him to touch me. \n He ended up getting erased from the medical register. I've not had any contact with him apart from the hearing and I'll be moving to a different deanery at the end of F2 so will be able to put everything behind me.\n I've also been in therapy since the incident and have healed in lots of ways. I've spoken with a lot of colleagues and it is surprisingly common but very few doctors report it. I hope that if someone can relate then they will have some hope that the system can protect you.

PAs and ACPs will ofc be used as replacements for doctors in all but name. \n If you haven't entered training, or already got a JCF lined up, the next year of unemployment (because that's what a locum F3 is) will be scary. \n Try to get on as many banks as possible and join locum agencies.

Coming out of the exam, I thought it went very well, I got the diagnoses, gave reasonable differentials and management. I opened my results and for around 4 stations I have not been given the marks that I know I earned. I won’t detail every station but be rest assured, I nailed a lot of those stations and was genuinely given half the marks I earned for a lot of them.\n I know for a fact that if the exam was video recorded I could load up a video of the stations, show it to another set of examiners and get awarded a pass. \n In-person medical exams are video recorded in the PLAB OSCES, US medical schools and some UK PhD VIVAs are recorded. It's entirely possible and worth the hassle to prevent doctors getting screwed over and getting our time and money unnecessarily taken away from us on top of pretty draining jobs. \n I think it's about time we stood up to the RCP and told them that we deserve exams that are objective, fair and consistent. \n Is this something others agree with? \n    submitted by    /u/alexdavidson1995  \n [link]   [comments]",

Many experts predict that AI will eventually revolutionize various medical specialties, but the timeline for this transformation remains uncertain. \n I’m curious to hear your thoughts on when AI might take over aspects of your specialty. Do you foresee AI replacing certain tasks or augmenting your clinical practice in the near future? For instance, in radiology, AI has already shown remarkable capabilities in image interpretation, diagnosis, and even predicting patient outcomes. Algorithms can analyze medical images with incredible accuracy, often outperforming human radiologists in certain tasks. \n As someone who hasn’t specialised yet I’m quite worried than sooner than most think an ai will be able to do the job better than a human unless it’s very hands on physical work \n    submitted by    /u/Extreme_Guess6639  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fortunately, it is also a city that I did my degree in and the plan was to stay in the same apartment while I do FY.\n Unfortunately, I had to make a difficult decision to split up with my long term partner who I am currently living with. I would like to find a new flat for myself, however, I am not sure if I will be a good candidate for this as I still do not have an employment contract (or a guarantor), even though I have been allocated jobs.\n Is it possible to move apartments this soon before starting FY and still sound credible to the landlord? Is there a letter that my employer can write that would state I will be starting a job in August if I fulfill all the requirements (eg GMC registration, finishing my degree)? My understanding is that you can only receive the actual contract much closer to the start date of your job so how do people manage to get a flat without moving last minute when they are allocated to a new part of the country?

Unfortunately haven't had a resp job and the nurses at the hospital I'm based at tend to adjust the settings very well on their own for the most part. It's really nice of them but I feel it's a gap in my knowledge I want to address.\n I have nights coming up where I will be covering the resp ward. Whilst the safe thing I am going to do is run past any NIV patients and ABGs I'm unsure about with the reg, I would be grateful if anyone could give their recommendations on how to go about learning NIV settings and adjusting them based on the blood gases? Also how it's decided to wean patients off NIV and how to go about that.\n Any books or resources would be great! Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Shadhilli  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example: browsing Twitter this morning, there is a prominent account- that shall remain anonymous- who regularly posts wide reaching, anti PA rhetoric. “Great”, you might think.\n Unfortunately; they also post a lot of nonsense. In the last month they have claimed to have been born and grown up in a working class council estate in the north of England, and a couple of weeks later claimed to have been an immigrant from another country moving here for university.\n I’m worried that, when unverified, popular, but questionable accounts (unclear if they are even genuinely a junior doctor) take charge of an important message like that on PAs, their own suspicious activity will damage the message they become so closely tied to.\n Can the BMA do more to advertise that they should be the official spokes people on PA matters in the same way they have been so successfully for strikes?\n This movement is too important to get brought down by questionable characters harnessing it for their own media profile.\n    submitted by    /u/Careful-Target4220  \n [link]   [comments]",

Quite frankly a lot of the general public don't have enough knowledge to be able to properly weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of complex treatment options, and we don't have the time to fully explain things in a way that these people will understand. We should make the decision and present the best option to them. I've seen too many patients recently make stupid choices regarding treatment because they don't understand the chances of success and failure. \n Example: Experienced vascular consultant gives patient option A and option B. Option A is to do partial foot amputation. Consultant informs patient that the resulting wound is extremely unlikely to heal due to PVD and that they will almost definitely need to return to surgery to do below knee amputation. Option B is to go straight to below knee amputation which will result in less time in hospital overall. Patient discussed with surgeon and agrees option B. Then family show up and are informed of plan and say \"No, absolutely not. We want a second opinion\". Patient then doesn't want to upset family and decides to choose option A. Patient has surgery, surgery fails, patient returns to theatres several weeks later. Leg is chopped off. Length of stay is longer. NHS has spent all the extra money of the first surgery for no reason. \n Surely it would have been better for the consultant to say \"This is the surgery that we need to do. It is the only option. Anything less will fail and I will not do pointless operations that have an extremely small chance of success*\"?\n *Unless lack of treatment would result in certain death anyway.\n    submitted by    /u/FuneralExitOffspring  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ensure I discuss most patients with the GPs to double check my plans or if I am unsure of what is going on. Despite this, I have found that I have already made 2 mistakes so far. One of them is a prescribing one where I prescribed a longer course of a medication than recommended as I think I misunderstood the GP's advice, I fortunately picked up on it when reading yesterday and will call the patient to let them know before it has any impact on them but this has made me anxious and underconfident. I have very rarely made an impactful mistake in hospital and I unfortunately have this overthinking habit so I struggle with uncertainty and will read up about anything I am unsure about after a work day to learn from it and as a coping mechanism. The downside to this is that I end up identifying issues more than my peers and while this helps patients, it also makes me doubt myself and I worry about my patients and the GPs losing trust in me.

Marvel as we apply years of medical training to a task so crucial, it can only be entrusted to those with an MBBS—no mere mortal staff could possibly click checkboxes with such precision. Forget the quaint notions of clinics and actual patient interaction; our nimble fingers are destined for the keyboard, crafting these digital epics in a blistering 3-5 minutes each. So on those rare, well-staffed days ripe for learning, remember, the true educational summit is not in the clinic, but in the glow of the discharge summary screen.

A 24yo woman presented with soft tissue injuries and dislocated shoulder, with a weekly alcohol intake of 34 units. Audit-C score was 7, but CIWA-A was only 1. No symptoms of AWS. A dispute started between the F1 doing the clerking and the bay nurse, about whether she needed immediate benzodiazepine treatment to prevent withdrawal seizures.\n It escalated in a ridiculous way to include the registrar on duty, then the charge nurse, then the ward sister. Their position was that we should give the full protocol, ours was that she'd been assessed at low risk and wasn't dependent. The charge nurse started threatening 'Datix for patient safety' and trying to strongarm the F1 into prescribing.\n The argument ended when the professor in charge of the take wandered towards the noise we were making. He listened for a minute, flicked through the patient notes briefly, glanced at the numbers, then turned to the charge nurse. \"My alcohol intake's higher than that, where's my benzodiazepines?\" Held out his hand and started making 'gimme' gestures. No response.\n Long story short, we stopped being asked to prescribe the meds.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Staterae  \n [link]   [comments]",

I suffered eye trauma in a freak accident, and thanks to your colleagues I've gone from a traumatic cataract, >60 intra-ocular pressure and other assorted grievances to successful surgery, dramatically improved vision and a low, manageable risk of glaucoma. \n I want to thank the brilliant people who helped me, in a way that gives them the recognition they deserve from the brass! No doubt they'll have handled much more serious matters than mine, but this was a scary episode nonetheless. Their skill and compassion made me feel safe - a profoundly valuable thing at a time of vulnerability. \n I gather that an email to PALS helps with the portfolio. What I'd like to know specifically: \n  \nWill a single email about everyone suffice? I don't remember everyone's name (I was seen by a lot of people), but should be able to provide enough identifying info. \n Will the brass read it?\n Will it be seen by the people themselves? On a personal level, I'd like them to know just how much I appreciate them.\n \n A couple of nuggets stand out: \n  \nThe doctor in A&E who calmed me and made me laugh when I was freaking out about my 60+ IOP, and who also had the humility to say that she had to check what to do with the glaucoma consultant. Knowing what you don't know and admitting it is surely the most noble form of intelligence. \n The consultant herself. I suppose we expect consultants to be expert and decisive (she was both), but she was also approachable, attentive and friendly over multiple appointments. \n  \nIt occurs to me that bedside manner is more memorable to patients than hard-earned clinical skill. Perhaps that's just because we understand it better. Anyway, it stays with you, and I salute you all for retaining your humanity in a society that under-values you. \n Sorry for banging on.

Been doing F3 and F4 locums via an agency (will keep their name off here) and have spoken to one of my colleagues about the use of umbrella companies. He has informed me that he uses the same company and is getting full take home pay and is sorting out his taxes with his accountants. He has said he has been happy with this arrangement but has recently found out through 2 different agency staff that used to work at this company that they where actually not paying the VAT and the agency staff would take a fixed percentage of this on a weekly basis in forms of a bonus from the \"umbrella company\". \n I was shocked by this and have spoken to a few agencies about this and been advised that there is only two companies that allow this practise and I am shocked and appalled by this. I've calculated it to be that some people can be making £2000 per week from their locum doctors. I have no proof other then these conversations but am I right to feel concerned and what is the best practise? I am not using the same company as my colleague so cant imagine it is being done with my pay.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/No_Sock_9168  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got offered a post in the South London Deanery, and I could use your expert opinions.\n The first thing that I am worried about is the cost of living. Will I be able to afford to live on my own in London with the salary of an ST3? Seeing that now I am almost 30 years old, I think I am ready to start making a step ahead in my life and try to get my own place. I dread the fact that I might be going into my early 30s and not being able to afford to live on my own. \n The second thing that I would like to ask for your advice on is which areas of London would you advise me to seek a house in. My deanery is going to be in South London, but I have heard rumours that it can be quite dangerous. I have never lived in a dangerous city in the past and I would rather avoid areas with high criminal rates. Which areas would you recommend? Do you think it is a good idea to live above the river and commute every day?\n One final thing that I would like to mention is that currently I am not able to afford a car, as I have spent a fortune on my Royal College exams, courses, study material etc. Will I be able to reach the hospitals in my Deanery using public transport or is owning a car a must?\n Many thanks! xoxo\n    submitted by    /u/DeadlyAssassins9  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before I knew the final patient outcome, I told the consultant about my anxiety around the situation and they said “it’s fine, you escalated it to me, it was my responsibility”, but obviously I didn’t write that on paper and they didn’t document anything after that. \n Fully expecting to be contacted about this case and am beyond anxious about how it will play out. \n I’m a foundation year. Will involvement in something like this affect my future career? \n As soon as I felt out of my depth with the symptoms, that’s when I handed it over to the consultant. Technically the symptom was escalated to me, but I didn’t know what to do so I escalated further. We all know the first month of rotation is very much finding your feet, I had no idea what to do in this specific situation, hence the further escalation as I wasn’t getting anywhere. If something goes wrong, do consultants often field the responsibility and inquests themselves or do they often bounce the blame back at the more junior doctor? \n I’m absolutely terrified and this physical and overwhelming anxiety is enough to make me seriously question a future in this career.

Ranked bottom order end. \n Im inclined to accept this as want to get into a structured program rather than spend time as trust grade or locum. I am split but generally glad tbh. \n Questions \n 1- what are the experiences of people who have done LAT? How does this affect applications next year? Does it help? 2- Any idea where Ill be spending the year? I would hope it would be ARI rather than iverness or shetland as that would be less than ideal. 3- What is the expected salary take home for st4 as i understand the taxes are different compared to England? 4- Any comments about training and training opportunities up north? 5- Any comments about living costs and accommodation \n Thanks in advance \n Kind regards \n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Step_5418  \n [link]   [comments]",

I then got into core surgical training on the second attempt - this was a huge feat for me and I worked damn hard to get in. I thought I’d made it. I thought I was finally going to be a surgeon. My CST years were some of the most gruelling of my life - i sacrificed so much to progress and prepare a portfolio for St3 applications. The MRCS exams took a huge mental toll on me. I sat Part A 3 times and passed Part B the first time. Regarding MRCS, I wasn’t alone. I know a lot of my colleagues who also had multiple attempts. Since finishing core surgical training, I have applied to ST3 Trauma and Orthopaedic surgery 3 times. I have been unsuccessful each time. I thought this year was different. I had prepared very well only to be thrown under the bus in the interview. The clinical scenarios were much harder than previous years and I feel like the whole interview process was just poorly delivered. I am also disappointing my family and friends by not getting a training number so the mental toll is a lot. I am planning to give it 1 more shot next year. I guess I just came to Reddit for some motivation during a time where I feel as though all hope is lost.\n    submitted by    /u/PorscheBurger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "IMT3 here, funnily enough IMT breeds burnout (who'd have thought it!). But everyone around me (literally every other IMT3 I work with) is hellbent on entering training ASAP as everyone says there won't be any training numbers left soon. Everyone else is off to take ST4 numbers in August. I've taken a more chilled approach this year as it doesn't seem to be quite the mega competition of core training (yet....) and my mental health is sort of in the toilet.\n I'd love 1-2 years out to decompress, see the world, see family, be a normal non doctor human. I'm pre kids so I could have a lot of freedom and nice times. Or I could aim for ST4 next round starting training in Feb 2025 (if I'm lucky, there should be numbers in areas of country I'd like to live in).....\n Is being a consultant lots better? Should I be pushing towards consultancy soon and ending the misery of med reg night shifts and rotating? Or will I be a 35 year old consultant with a couple of kids regretting prioritising my career over a couple of fufilling years out of training?\n I'm female and expect to take a few mat leaves and then LTFT so I suspect I won't get there very fast regardless, it's whether or not I add 1-2 years extra on by taking some time to chill now vs cracking on with HST for a couple years at 100%. We see young people die at work which I think skews my view that life is short and work doesn't matter all that much.\n I'd love to hear from anyone who entered ST4 after a couple of years out, do you regret it now when you see people who were at your stage and are now consultants whilst you're still working nights? Or do you feel lucky that you had amazing experiences that you just can't have in your 40s/50s when tied down by kids and a mortgage?\n P.S.

          "description": "I'll start off with fonts and styles. This may be of importance to those doctors whose work is text-intensive and where quality of presentation matters e.g. senior doctors in psychiatry and expert witness doctors. \n In psychiatry the work is text intensive for producing reports of various kinds: Tribunal reports, Managers' reports, CPA, CTR, Court of Protection and so on. Presentancy is 'everything' (chuhknowwhuhahmean). Most 'medics' - or is that doctors - don't give a monkeys about fonts or Styles. Some don't know what's that Style ribbon at the top of MS Word is for, nor do their typists (secretaries or admins). I'm not doing a tutorial on that here. \n What is of relevance is that for the doctors who need to format there work for 'presentancy' and readability (like me) are being told that Trusts require all correspondence to be in Arial 12pt, by policy. No such policy has been found over the last 10 years of me searching for it across 10 Trusts. I dare say it does not exist.\n But wait - I started off with one issue to illustrate something else that happens in your beloved NHS What's that?\n Loads of people make up policies as they go along. The commonest is 'good practice'. Nobody quoting anything of 'good practice' has been able to provide me with a reference to the 'good practice'. \n The other one was \"No patient gets Sectioned unless they have a CTR (care and treatment review).\" No such policy exists in writing anywhere and if it exists it is legally wrong. \n And another, \"Intensive support must be consulted before a LD patient is sectioned\". Doesn't exist. Can't find that anywhere (though it may well exist in a neck of the woods somewhere that I've not been). \n I'd like to hear from those who have witnessed the same sort of making up of policies. \n    submitted by    /u/Capitan_Walker  \n [link]   [comments]",

She was great, and I learnt stuff from her when I was asking questions about management, and it seemed that everything right was done for baby.\n But an ACP? To essentially a crash call? For adults senior doctors attend. So what is going on here? The ACP seemed quite well versed in everything, but this doesn’t sit right with me. \n There was a point where the ACP said “if things don’t improve by x time, I’m calling my reg”, but why wasn’t a paediatrician there initially? NICU is on the same floor!!! \n I know that even paeds isn’t safe from scope creep and noctors, but can’t we get real doctors to attend to a neonatal emergency.\n Maybe this was because it hadn’t quite gotten to cardiac arrest?

          "description": "I'm on a community placement and we often get medical students coming through. Last week we had a student join us during the morning MDT meeting and introduced herself as a medical student. We did a few cases together during the week and she seemed uninterested in anything I had to teach but was very keen to jump in and take over the patient interviews. I didn't mind her confidence but she took irrelevant histories and didn't seem to understand a lot of basics. She always tried to go out of her way to agree with the consultant and it felt like she was trying to \"one up\" me. It really didn't seem like normal behaviour for a medical student so figured she was just a very driven student who had yet to start her downward journey on the dunning-kruger graph.\n I found out from one of the nurses that she was a nursing student, and was told many of them introduce themselves as medical students, which we agreed was disingenuous. She later confirmed that she would be finishing nursing school soon when asked in front of our MDT.\n I'm not originally from the UK, but is it normal for nursing students to identify themselves as medical students? I was introducing her as a medical student, and now I'm feeling guilty about misleading my patients.\n    submitted by    /u/earnest_yokel  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I was an international student that graduated from a UK medical school in 2020 and completed FY1. Due to issues at home I had to leave the UK and foundation programme post FY1 to be at home and have been working in my home country as an SHO grade doctor since in Internal Medicine (staying until the end of FY2 was not really a viable option at the time). \n When I had left post FY1, my foundation school was under the impression that if I were to consider coming back, this would be via a standalone F2 post or CREST form - which I have been made aware in the last few years that CREST is only open to doctors who have never been in the foundation program. \n Was wondering if anyone has advice on available routes back to the UK, as well as if I were to attempt to return - if it would have to be back at F2 level or if I would be able to apply for training later on should I plan to complete further qualifications eg MRCP exams. \n Thank you! \n    submitted by    /u/blahblahdoc  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n So, I work on an elderly care discharge ward, where people are supposed to be MOFD. But spending months waiting for social issues to sort out, they keep getting new medical issues.\n Plus, there are chronic medical issues that families want taken care of, while they are in the hospital, as an opportunistic bonus.\n Now, its basically just me and a PA (nice but relatively new). Before, it was me and another SHO and we used to divide patients evenly.\n We're being told to prioritize TTOs rather than clinical reviews because pharmacy can't process orders (dosette boxes) in time if we do them after noon\n The issue at hand is that i usually need time to look at a patient my own way, and write in my own style. I'm a bit conscious of making sure that I'm not missing any key details when reviewing a patient, or that any TTO I write is well written.\n Also, the ward manager is insisting that instead of breaking up patients, we divide tasks instead. Things like \"Oh, the PA can write the discharge summary and you can prescribe.....\"\n The PA is a nice lady and she can take bloods decent enough...(somewhat)\n The problem is, I can't review patients late (all the investigation results and imaging gets delayed), and I seriously hate prescribing meds (Especially CDs) when the written portion is a missing key details (like why a drug was discontinued or whether a resus status was changed)\n I take pride in my work, and want to do it in its entirety.\n Does anyone how to handle this kinda workload?\n It's gotten so bad that normally, an MOFD patient is supposed to be reviewed every week just to see if they're ok, and no one's reviewing them for 2-3 weeks.\n    submitted by    /u/hadriancanuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

From 1 October 2022 Officer pension contribution tiers in England and Wales are linked to actual pensionable pay and not the notional full time equivalent rate.\"\n NHSBA seems to suggest differently \"Overtime, in relation to the NHS Pension Scheme, is hours worked in excess of the whole time standard working week. Therefore a part timer’s pensionable pay must include any additional hours worked up to the whole time working week, and hours worked over the whole time working week are not pensionable. For example, if the standard working week is 37.5 hours, a part timer normally working 20 hours a week may pay pension contributions on up to 17.5 additional hours per week.\"\n But then also this from NHSBA? \"The payroll solution must use the previous scheme years actual pensionable earnings to set the member contribution rate (instead of using whole-time equivalent earnings). If the member did not work a full year the actual earnings should be annualised.\"\n ​\n What's right?

          "description": "I'm peripherally involved in simulation training at my local medical school. The simulator is pretty simple: a mannequin, a monitor, some dummy drugs to be drawn up or checked, some blood gas print outs and people pretending to be nurses, registrars etc. The trainees are final year medical students, FY1s and FY2s. The simulated scenarios are vanilla adult medical and surgical emergencies in which the trainee is called to the ward for a patient that's \"gone off\".\n The scenarios themselves seem pretty realistic and I try to make the debriefings as educational as possible using the After Action Review model, but it seems the trainees get no particular preparation on emergencies before the simulation day and there's no follow up afterwards on lessons identified. It's just one or two simulator days a year in isolation. I've discussed this with the faculty who run the simulator but their view is that preparation and follow up are Someone Else's Problem.\n Has anyone had better experience of sim training than this?\n    submitted by    /u/larus_crassirostris  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thank you in advance. \n A 45 year old is admitted with palpitations following excess alcohol consumption at a wedding. His BP is 90/50 and his HR is 130 bpm and regular. \n Bloods were all normal. \n ECG: \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/bem4y970fgwc1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=faf881537e2f7eb1ebe14df8a66049b28581e976\n What is the most appropriate intervention?\n Amiodarone\n Digoxin\n DC Cardioversion\n Metoprolol \n Verapamil \n ​\n I thought that since he's haemodynamically unstable we would go for DC cardioversion however the answer is amiodarone. They stated that since the patient has a junctional tachycardia the treatment of choice is either IV amiodarone or IV flecainide. \n I had a read about junctional tachycardia vs SVT. \n So junctional tachycardia is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR >100. SVT is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR >150. \n I've been trying to find a good paper to explain the management of junctional tachycardias because it sounds a bit different compared with SVT but I can't find anything. One paediatric paper said that we can give amiodarone, another said phenytoin. And wikipedia has actually been the most helpful and said that we don't normally do DC cardioversion in junctional tachycardia. \n Is anyone able to shed some light on the management of junctional tachycardia and how it differs to SVT?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/CoconutFrequent8576  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's been praised by both political parties, but criticised by trans groups and international organisations.\n Apart from the merits of these changes, does anyone know why this took the form of an independent service review rather than a national guideline by NICE/ RCPCH/ RCPsych or if there are plans to produce one in the future. As far as I can work out the old GIDS service was working off the The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines which have now been declared unacceptable by Dr Cass.

You don’t have enough experience to secure a training number, and there are no locum opportunities. So what do you do? You’re essentially unemployed from a medical point of view. No fellowships, no trust grade jobs. All over subscribed. \n I give it 2-3 years before doctors unemployed in hundreds if not thousands. What can be done? I’m not sure if I’m being honest.

I'm due to start GP ST1 in August 24 and in the last two weeks have been sent over 10 emails with various links and various forms to fill in. I am grateful for the job and I feel like I shouldn't complain about this but I'm just lost in a sea of HR words and documents and waffle!\n As a little summary of the things I've been sent:\n - A welcome letter, a privacy guide to sign, a guide about how to use the 'TIS' system, had to make an account on the TIS system, then complete Form A/B of Form R on the TIS system, and a joining form, and remember to change my revalidation body on GMC website to my new education trust but only 7 days before I start the new job not earlier than that, and register with RCGP but only once I've done form R so then they can give me a training number which I then need to use on the RCGP application but it must only be for a training post, make sure I'm on the GP performers list, do a pre-health declaration form where I also need to find a life time history of my vaccinations, register for a TRAC account, sort out DBS etc etc etc ........... sigh \n Each individual form takes me ages to fill in aswell because of poorly worded questions or tasks where I need to dig out previous evidence etc. \n Does anyone else feel this way? \n    submitted by    /u/panda-loaf  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys! I hope you can shine some light on my dilemma. \n I have recently been accepted for an MBA in a top business school with a 50% scholarship - which is still a big investment. For some context, I am an IMG doctor and I co-founded a startup in London after my foundation training which went well but never took off. Last year I decided that it was time to do something different and I applied for the MBA and took a Clinical Fellow post. During my Clinical fellow post (part-time) I rediscovered my passion for medicine and how nice it is to directly help people and I managed to get an IMT spot in the reserve list in an ok location. The MBA would give me a higher salary on a corporate job but it would take me away from medicine and I am not sure I am ready for it! I am thinking about declining or at least trying to defer the MBA offer to next year and do 1 year of IMT to see how I feel. Everyone that I spoke with told me that I would regret my choice and that I am romanticising medicine as I haven't been full-time in a long time. \n I want to hear your opinion on that, especially from doctors and consultants who like what they do. Is it that bad? What about when you become a consultant? Am I making the wrong decision?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Apart_Doctor_5804  \n [link]   [comments]",

He was previously informed that I would be seeing him at a certain time. I was then told that he was busy masturbating. I asked someone to ask him to clean up as I'll be there in a few minutes, me thinking he'd be done by then. Minutes pass. I get to outside his room (door closed). Staff tell me \"He's still at it.\" So I waited about 10 minutes outside of his room. Someone said I should knock and enter. I did not. I spoke with staff outside of his room for the 10 minutes. Then I had to depart for a meeting as I was now running late. He then opened the door to his room as I was about to depart and seemed to want to talk. I couldn't as I was going to be late for the important meeting. I thought there was a funny side but off course said nothing of the sort. I breached no standard of practice as far as I am aware. \n I am unable to reveal other details - and don't ask why. I don't know how staff knew he was still at it. \n When one meets an unexpected first, one obviously wonders about what one would do if the situation presented itself again. \n Opinions sought from the hive mind. \n If you're not that interested gimme your view in the poll below.\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/Capitan_Walker  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Seems like a lot of people on this subreddit are very pro-CCT and flee, but was curious if most people expressing these views are ST4+? \n Currently an ST1 and training's been alright - it's shielded from a lot of NHS bullshit, but you're still working for the NHS. \n Ophthalmology is switching to a new curriculum next year, but I'm skeptical this will significantly reduce training length. At the moment, I'm anticipating to CCT in probably 7-8 years after all of ST and ?fellowship assuming I stay 100% and pass all my exams/expected competencies in a reasonable time frame. \n I know people have talked about going to Australia or the Middle East, but frankly I'm not that keen on the latter, and if everyone's thinking of going to Australia or Canada after CCT-ing - what is the landscape even going to look like for me when I flee 8 years down the line? 😅 I do predict there will be healthcare shortages, but I would think locally, they'd also be looking to expand medical school/training places to accommodate in the next decade too. Is the prospect of CCT and flee as an ST1 even realistic?\n Also, I know ophthalmology is one of the more lucrative specialties, so surely there must be some barriers in place to emigrating vs a specialty that has a more supportive role (e.g. rads, anaes).\n    submitted by    /u/ophthalmologyornot  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m working 8-6 Thursday and Friday, 8-8:30 Saturday, 8-8 Sunday, bank holiday Monday, then 8-6 Tuesday - Friday. Does the bank holiday count as splitting up the shifts and therefore no zero day is needed? I have this on a couple of other occasions (working Thursday through to the following Friday, but without the bank holiday) and after raising this (for a few months), I’ve been given the Monday as a zero day to break up the 9-day stretch. However they are refusing to give a zero day on the week with a bank holiday. They also state because I moved the working weekend I’m not owed a zero day (I moved the weekend before they agreed to give me any zero days at all, so I’d argue if I cancel my swap I need my zero day, then reinstate the swap). Note, the working pattern given above is the original rotation (as if the weekend had not been swapped). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.\n Also, do the swaps also have to comply with rotation rules? Because I had no zero day to swap, where I’ve swapped my weekend to is now a 9-day stretch instead.\n    submitted by    /u/Ordinary_Lemon_1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel like I've forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn't that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don't remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.\n Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO's (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I've been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I've also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I've contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? \n Just for a little more info: I’m starting on gen surg. Also I'm hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I'm honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I'm working a 9-5 office job which I'm looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. \n Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I'm ready to put my best foot forward and I’m honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound.

          "description": "Hi everyone, incoming fy1 here interested in physics, maths and engineering related specialties. What sort of pathway could I go down to explore these topics more in medicine? I understand radiology has a decent amount of physics and there’s certain specialties like nuclear medicine to consider, both of which interest me a lot. I am just wondering what other things I could be doing alongside going into these specialties that could get me into a field that has a decent balance of medicine and physics/engineering. I have considered PhD programs to do with biomedical engineering that might lend to a more academic career, or ones that I could do alongside my radiology training, would like to know more about this.\n Would love to know if anyone here has gone down such a route or if anyone knows anything about it. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/adventurefoundme  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not to necessarily say \"this is medically fine\" or \"go full steam ahead with production\", but more to explain some of the issues from a medical standpoint and the repercussions should something go wrong.\n Any risk would theoretically be covered by their indemnity and lawyers, and a document would be prepared stating that they've consulted a doctor for advice but that the company is entirely responsible and culpable for their own decisions\n My questions boil down to is this an acceptable thing to do? \n I'm not an expert in any regard, and I'm still a junior doctor.

Yesterday I get a message to book an appointment at a clinic for the scan. This has to be booked by me.\n They give me one option for a clinic I can’t even reach and they did not have any appointments I call the GP and the secretary changes the clinic to somewhere more local but apparently also no appointments. So I have to wait for them to contact me and sort which could be weeks or months. And this lump is causing me some pain and discomfort and I want the scan faster than ever.\n I know there’s more people to check and stuff but like me overthinking and it now causing discomfort something that will take a short time to do and having to wait ages for it is getting annoying\n    submitted by    /u/CH3R03  \n [link]   [comments]",

The title is so silly of course I can still work but I just thought that I now have a bad record.\n So I am now overseas in my home country but I used to work in the UK as a health professional at a private firm almost 2 years ago for several months. Unfortunately I was dismissed from the job so I went back to my country temporarily - at the time I was paranoid cause I was in a sponsorship and I assumed losing my job means that I will lose my right to work (I checked on gov.uk website and I still have the right to work 🥲)\n To set things clear - I have not been removed from the register. I was not able to pass my probation period cause boss told me basically that my progress was slower than they expected and some competencies were unticked at the end of the probation.\n Right now I’m planning to go back. I am currently employed in a hospital here. But right now I have no idea if NHS accepts or even considers candidates like me who has a history of being dismissed. Any thoughts??\n Also I’ve heard rumors that NHS is becoming “cautious” right now with hiring overseas applicants due to political uncertainties.

Is this common for GPs to just not refer a patient who is actively suicidal or displays very bizarre behaviour during a consultation? I cover 9 practices (by myself) and this occurs across all 9 practices.

I'm also non-urgent and currently am swamped with the amount of people on my wait list. I'm worried someone is actually going to die waiting for me to get to them and feel like the GPs can't be bothered to do the referral/legwork so send them to me instead.\n We had a meeting a while back (monthly staff training) where reps from local MH trusts and charities came to talk to us about how to refer and some of the GPs were sniggering into their phones and talking amongst themselves whilst these people were speaking.

          "description": "I'm curious whether anyone can offer insights here. I've contextualised but please be aware I am not asking for advice on my situation.\n A couple of years ago I was the victim of serious intimate partner violence. Since then I've accessed therapy and counselling, I've been on medication...no luck (don't worry, I'm not seeking advice). A year ago I requested a psychiatry referral as both myself and my GP suspected PTSD and figured I could use tailored treatment and a diagnosis would help me advocate for myself. This resulted in a phone call with the Access team that lasted all of 10 minutes, I wasn't assessed by anyone but I was discharged to Healthy Minds.\n Healthy Minds didnt help and neither did SARC. A year on and I've deteriorated massively, I'm completely socially withdrawn, I've lost 2 stone (I was 9 stone) and my personality has taken a 180 into volatility central. My ex is undergoing sentencing so my symptoms are exacerbated badly by the resurfacing of everything. In light of things getting worse I put in another referral for assessment.\n Had another phone call today and within 2 minutes they're recommending I be discharged to Healthy Minds based on the consultant's reading of my file (I was speaking with his secretary I think?). I wound up losing my rag and after about 20 minutes the lady began assessing me and conceded that my symptoms are in line with C-PTSD and should be reviewed.\n My question is, is this common in the mental health services in the NHS? Psychiatrists not assessing people, just skimming over their files when the referral comes through and deciding \"ah, it's probably fine\"? I hear people lament others not calling out for help so often, but if most people are anything like me they're begging for help and being let down by bureaucracy.\n    submitted by    /u/YarnleyFelt  \n [link]   [comments]",

A bad tooth broke a few weeks ago and for the past week it's been hurting bad, and at this point I've been eating ibuprofen like candy with barely if any relief. I don't have a dentist, I know I need a root canal treatment (as my last dentist a while back said I will) which no way I can afford private, I'm already late on rent... I sent a enquiry at a dentist office to see if they're taking new NHS patients but I'm only going to get an answer tomorrow since it's a Sunday. I'm also waiting for a call back from 111 though im not hopeful they can help much since I can't afford private treatment. Is there anything else I can do? At least some way to get a stronger painkiller in the meantime (like Naproxen which has worked well in the past)?

          "description": "I have a question about the dynamics of referrals within hospitals.\n I have a friend who presented to A&E with worsening chest pain & palpitations after their renal consultant advised them to present to A&E if they ever got worse.\n Background of sharply declining CKD5 and a small pericardial effusion discovered during transplant workup echo.\n After 13 hour wait to see a doctor in A&E overnight, then many more hours in the department they decided they would consult renal & maybe cardiology. A few hours later they were admitted to AMU.\n Still on the AMU this morning they spoke to their renal consultant, based at that hospital, by phone and found that nobody had consulted renal at all at any point. The renal consultant has now paged a registrar to get involved.\n Talking about this in our CKD patients support group chat it seems some variant of this story, a lack or delay of referral is a fairly common experience. One person even had to involve his local MP to get his care and subsequent transplant process moving again.\n Is this just bad luck? Or is there a systemic issue that prevents these types of referrals from happening promptly? I'm imagining some poor medical SHO that's got 500 million jobs to do and has been shouted out for making referrals too keenly before.\n    submitted by    /u/JimBlizz  \n [link]   [comments]",

She answered questions about my levels of anxiety with completely made up answers even though I am seeing a private therapist for these anxiety problems.\n I said to her on the phone I was not happy with her cavalier attitude regarding my medical records and that this couldn’t be a “mistake” since she knowingly filled my record with bs data. That’s when she said I should stop being condescending towards her…\n I must say I am pretty shocked following this encounter, she apologised for making a “mistake” and that she “understood my frustration” she actually asked me the questions she had taken upon herself to answer in my stead and surprise surprise, her “clinical judgment” was a mile off my actual answers.\n Is this normal/ok?

But I’m currently working in a call centre for a bank and I absolutely despise it. So I’m quite nervous at the thought of this job being similar to my current one. I really don’t want to be stuck on calls all day speaking to people. I don’t enjoy it!!! \n So any input would be appreciated. Would it be like working in a call centre or would it be more relaxed? I’m just so confused and I was excited for the interview but the more I read the job description, my excitement fades. I’m trying to get out of call centre work and I’m starting to think this job is a call only job the more I read into it. \n I attached a few points from the Job Description above.

          "description": "Hola, \n I'm currently a band 2 clinic receptionist and have got two interviews for band 3 positions. One being associate clinical coder and one being admin support typist. The support typist role would be an upgrade within my current department and the clinical coding is a complete sidetrack. I'm confident enough in my science to deal with the clinical coding job as I've also done it on the side in my current role. Admin support typists in theory would be a lot more chill but the progression would be gated to gathering experience and then applying for band 4 roles over just progressing naturally from acc to cc and getting a band up. For anyone that has been in this position (or anyone in general) what would you say is the better option?\n    submitted by    /u/limboxd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have to email all the time to remind them to put it up as they conveniently forget.\n We pick shifts up on a WhatsApp group but there have been times when bank staff came in the office at 8am and were sent home as they weren't added on the \"paper rota\". Rationale was that shift were not confirmed over email or e-roaster only in Whatsapp group.\n This is extremely frustrating and bank staff managers can't do anything without an email confirmation but they are refusing to reply to emails confirming shifts.\n I've sent an email about my upcoming shift on the 1st of May that I've picked up over Whatsapp group, but haven't heard back. \n What should I do?\n What can I do to stop this abusive behavior?\n    submitted by    /u/Complete_Relative521  \n [link]   [comments]",

For the past 4-5 months I’ve had several gp appointments/A&E visits for ongoing chest pain which is getting worse and spreading to other areas (my neck/back/legs). I’ve had the general tests done & an ECG which all came back fine. I’ve been told it is anxiety & there is nothing they can do and I should get counselling.

They keep suggesting I need counselling, but don’t put anything in place for me to gain access to it? I was prescribed diazepam after an A&E visit and it made no difference. Paracetamol and other pain killers have not helped in the slightest either. I had another GP appointment today and my doctor literally sighed at me and told me there is nothing they can do and I should look into psychiatric help, then sent me off home with nothing put in place. Shouldn’t they be the ones arranging that help? I’m at my wits end.\n I’m exhausted from the constant pain & feel helpless because I’m repeatedly being brushed off. I’m willing to believe it’s anxiety as it’s all I hear, but no one’s telling me how to fix it. I don’t feel anxious at all which is what is utterly confusing me, I’m just in a lot of physical pain and it’s unbearable. What can I do in this situation?

          "description": "I’m 35 (f) will be 36 at end of this year. I’ve got quite a varied background in terms of career. Teacher for 5 years, then moved to IT project management following a software MSc and stayed for almost 7 years. Recently I’ve been struggling in my PM job with the pressure/hours/internal mismanagement and decided to follow my 18yo self’s dream of working in healthcare and becoming a nurse so I took a job as a HCA in a local trust with a view to studying and working at the same time to become an RN.\n Nearly a month in and I’m miserable. There’s an underlying culture of bullying from management to lower bands and it’s bitchy and there are obvious cliques. The drs and senior nurses are really patronising and often make jokes that I’m the most overqualified HCA they’ve ever had. The pay is horrific (which I knew) and my elderly parents are leaning on me increasingly for financial support. My partner and I are thinking of starting a family soon and as I’m not getting any younger I think it might be wise to return to corporate (not to the same company) for more stability, better wage and more flexibility once we have kids.\n Should I stick it out with healthcare or go back to corporate? My issue was more with the company I worked for as a PM as opposed to the work. I figure that time isn’t on my side in terms of having a family and that’s more important to me than anything right now.

          "description": "Questions: 1. Are SIGN guidelines the equivalent of NICE in Scotland? 2. If so, could anyone direct me to the SIGN guidelines for the treatment of EUPD (I’m struggling to find them). 3. If not, are they generally the same as the NICE guidelines? 4. Any general advice would be appreciated. \n Context: I was “unofficially” diagnosed with EUPD a really long time ago and no one ever told me. I’m contesting it with the CMHT and not being listened to. \n From reading the NICE guidelines, generally my take away was that the patient should be fully informed and involved in their treatment. This didn’t happen with me. When I’ve asked about diagnosis before I’ve only been told “we don’t want to diagnose you, just treat symptoms”. No psychology referrals were ever explained to me. I went to them so I wouldn’t be discharged from services but they were geared towards trauma and consistent emotional dysregulation and it confused me honestly. \n This year however, I’ve been talking very directly about diagnosis and still only receiving deflection. I was treated very obviously for it at a crisis centre but they wouldn’t be honest. I brought it up directly several times saying I don’t agree that I have the condition. I had to make a subject access request to confirm. (I now see the lack of good practice that led to the assumption and it’s pretty shocking). \n The Mental Welfare Commission told me that if I asked about diagnosis I should have been told one of two things: 1. You’re being treated for EUPD 2. We don’t want to disclose your diagnosis to you because it may worsen your condition. They also told me I should have been told one of these anyway unprompted. \n It doesn’t appear that I’ve been treated in accordance with anything, but I’d appreciate some clarity on this? \n Thanks. \n    submitted by    /u/Kilchomanempire  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Bit of a confusing title, but hope someone can offer an opinion?\n I had an usual mole scanned at Boots and uploaded to a consultant dermatologist. I received a call to say it looked benign but has been marked as suspicious due to it's location - removal and biopsy were recommended. GP took it seriously as they also provide this service and reffered me on the two week pathway.\n I was seen a couple of days ago at the hospital and the doctor couldn't have been more judgemental and dismissive of me using the mole scanning service. Despite admitting he'd never heard of it. Accused it of being some AI app that just increases their workload. I was made to feel like a silly time waster before he'd even examined me.\n When he did examine me, he concluded that my mole was very atypical and suspicious and needed an exision biopsy!!!\n Anyway, this will be done in 2-4 weeks. In the meantime I've been reading about The Mole Clinic which appears very reputable and provides a consultation and exision which is then sent for biopsy on the same day.\n OK, perhaps they still not might be to see me within a week and the NHS time-frame isn't really that bad considering, but then up to another 2 weeks for results. It'll be about a 4-6 wait in total.\n However if I get this done privately then I'll effectively be discharging myself from the NHS clinic which feels super risky. Then, if the mole comes back as cancerous, I'll be screwed because I'm assuming I'd have to be re-referred by my GP? I don't think they'd be happy about that, and then would the hospital clinic even take me back as an urgent referral after binning them off?\n It seems like a bad idea, right? I think my anxiety about it is affecting my judgements.\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Long_Ant_6510  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m on a fixed term contract and for whatever reason my initial contract ended on the 28th March and was not extended on ESR till almost the end of this month. This means that I have missed the cut off date for this month’s pay.\n I was told all this was due to delays from execs in signing the business case and several forms that needed approval from different departments such as finance and HR. To me this is non of my fault and have been told that an advance has been submitted but from what I know and what I’ve been told by colleagues is that I will only be paid about half or 60% of the full amount I’m scheduled to get which is a pain.\n I was the advance will be made within 24hrs of payday which is Monday. When questioned whether it is possible to get the full amount or at least confirm the amount I’m getting they seem to deflect both question saying I’ll get it the other amount owed in the my next payslip. Is there any way of me getting the full amount within next week ? \n I’ve just recently moved into an apartment and it requires month in advance and this months rent all together as well as deposit so money is really tight and could do with getting paid the full amount…\n Has anyone had this problem before?

I thought I needed to just check they were okay today after the second fall (lump on their head) so took them to the UTC. After being triaged and waiting for a few hours we saw a doctor (FY2).

On one hand I get it, ward clerks are comparatively low in numbers compared to most other hospital roles, but on the other hand I want to know that a union will be looking out for us just as much as they do for the roles with big numbers.\n Open to any advice on which union might be best for ward clerks and if there's any other unions to suggest please do.\n    submitted by    /u/-Twokad-  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I was in a diagnostic session with the consultant psychiatrist in my local NHS recovery team. My GP referred me to them for a PTSD diagnosis, CPA, talking therapies, and medication advice.\n I was taken aback during the latest session when the psychiatrist began really pushing me to look at going privately for talking therapies.\n I get that the NHS is crumbling - I work in the same NHS Trust - but it felt really wrong to me that an NHS professional should advocate for going against the founding principles of the NHS.\n Does anyone else feel that this is unethical?\n —\n Extra information: I have the distinct impression that the recovery service really doesn’t want to take me on because I need significant reasonable adjustments to their usual ways of working. My autism and ADHD impact my presentation of mental health symptoms, and I need lots of additional time to process emotions and information. The local IAPT straight up rejected me as ‘too complex,’ and told my GP to send me to recovery. But it feels that rather than adapt and adjust, recovery want to find any reason to reject me too.\n    submitted by    /u/Animorphus1  \n [link]   [comments]",

There’s been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I’ve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn’t use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I’m not even sure if I’m going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I’m really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the “usual surgery risks” (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). \n I’ve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don’t have have savings as they’ve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can’t tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement.

He sexually assaulted me. I didn't report it, so no official complaint is logged.\n He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.\n Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.\n I soon moved because I didn't want to be anywhere near him.\n He's contacted friends asking where I am.\n My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex's part of the hospital. My relative's mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.\n My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn't understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.\n My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he'd be far enough away and chances low.\n Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.\n More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.\n My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.\n I don't know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.\n Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen?

          "description": "Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks' time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.\n Near the top of the letter is a phone number to 'reschedule or cancel'. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to 'reschedule or cancel', it seems reasonable that if I don't contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there's a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.\n I wasn't sure what to do, so I figured I'd ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven't been able to get through to anyone.\n So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I'm unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?\n I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I've been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I'm terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.\n Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).\n Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.\n    submitted by    /u/permabearish  \n [link]   [comments]",

After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what's causing my stomach pain.\n Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were \"inconclusive.\" I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.\n This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.\n This has been going on for years and I'm frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements. What can I do??? \n    submitted by    /u/cheappapayasoap  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently downloaded the NHS app & it shows which medication I am on, but it's not showing my medical condition! Which I've had since birth, it's not showing on the NHS app! I've been at my current doctors for 5 years & they're aware of my medical history. It says medical Condition 0. \n I asked my doctors & they asked me to put it in writing which I did. Does anyone know how long it will take to get my full medical history from birth if possible? Because I was really sick as a child. My mum told me had different medical issues which I later found out I didn't. thank you.\n Thank you to everyone.

          "description": "TW for mention of death. \n I apologise for asking such a blunt question, but I’ve always wondered about this and wondered if anyone can inform me. \n I always think about the paramedic who informed me that my Mum had passed away, many years ago. She died in a very upsetting and traumatic way, and from what I understand, the visual would have been really upsetting. I did not see her. \n I always think of him and I wonder what kind of support he would have been given. Is there an official process? Is there mandatory counselling given after incidents like this? \n Thank you in advance, and apologies for the morbid question. \n    submitted by    /u/faeriesandfoxes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a medical exemption card. When I went to get a prescription earlier, they said ‘and you have a pre-paid certificate right?’ And I said ‘no I have a medical exemption’ and they looked puzzled and said they have me down as pre-paid certificate. I showed my card, they then entered the correct type and all was fine. \n What has now worried me is I’ve collected prescriptions a couple of times from here previously, one last week and one in January. I’m pretty sure I showed my card then or said I had a medical exemption. Any chance they wrote down the wrong type at one point and now that’s stored on my file? Could I get penalised by the NHS BSA if it looks like l’ve claimed on this when I haven’t? Maybe they’d see if I have a medical exemption and it’d be ok, but not sure how their checking system works. \n I will go into the pharmacy tomorrow just to check with them, but thought I’d ask on here as it’s causing a little anxiety.
