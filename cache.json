The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. \n“The new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. “The new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.”\nWHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S.  \nVaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.  \nThere were 473 000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",

However, it would be really helpful if anyone could answer any one of them.\n I am someone considering making General Practice my career. I don't know any GPs on a personal level to ask any of my questions. So, for the past few months, I have been doing intensive reading about GP online. However, I have seen a lot of contradicting opinions. Therefore, I made this account so that I could clear my doubts instead of waiting for each and every post on Reddit to see if it answers my queries. I hope this is the right place to ask. If not, please feel free to redirect me.\n 1.What do you see as the future of GPs in the UK?\n I recently read a post about removing PAs from GP practices. Al…",

Hear me out.\n PA's are here to stay, there is no denying this (as much as many in this sub, myself included, don't like the idea), but I think I've figured out how they can actually be a very beneficial part of the team and how they can enhance our GP workflow. Hear me out...\n In some American and Canadian GP workplace models, the GP walks between different clinical rooms which are staffed by either PA's or Nurses. They take the initial history, dig through the clinical letters for relevant information, do some observations/exams, urine dips, etc., and when ready call in the GP to assess, examine and formulate a management plan. The GP is able to hover between a few clinical rooms this way and see 40+ patients per session with ease as all of the admin and documentation burden will be taken care of by the PA/Nurse (save for prescribing).\n By using this model here in the UK we can still keep PA's within the GP setting and enhance our own workflows while maintaining patient safety, patient satisfaction and our own sanities when it comes to managing our day-to-day clinical work and the added mountain of admin that keeps forever piling higher and higher.\n I honestly don't see any other way forward when it comes to having PA's in the GP setting (given everything that's talked about them in this sub) but I'm more than welcoming of any scrutiny in regards to my groundbreaking and definitely 110% original idea.\n    submitted by    /u/Ozky  \n [link]   [comments]",

These rotations are for 6 months each, as is the case in Wessex deanery - which is long but is what it is.\n I’ve done 2yrs locuming in ED including Paeds ED so I’m quite confident in that bracket of adult patients + Paeds.\n Wanted to avoid gen med rotations as thought they wouldn’t be too helpful.\n Are these jobs likely to be useful? Or would I have been better off with a paeds/psych/o+g job even having done the 2yrs ED? \n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/rabies50  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As a US MD working in primary care in the US it is clear to see the root cause of the problem with UK primary care. That is the lack of direct patient contribution to the office visit I.e FATPOA. \n Because of FATPOA you can never meet patient demand put an extra 500 appointments on per day you will fill them put a 1000 you will fill them. You can never meet demand. Because patients don't pay they have no respect for your time, opinion or you! Good analogy is if McDonald's said right everything free 24/7 would they ever meet demand? Nope! \n Here there is a copay it forces people to use their common sense first like use a pharmacist, self care etc also as they pay they respect your opinion and your time also. They are also far more polite. \n Also you can be a PCP in internal medicine only here so I only see adults no children. Salary of 300k is also very good for a max of 18 patients a day. I got called by a recruiter today offering another job an hour away for 400k salary such is the shortage in primary care here. \n    submitted by    /u/fred66a  \n [link]   [comments]",

You get relocation money plus a very good pension scheme 401k etc \n \nCopays - As patients pay directly towards your consultation they have much more respect for you and your time. Also they will try self care, pharmacy etc etc. They also know it's easy for a Dr to code their visit in such a way their bill will be jacked up to the max (level 4 consult) so they know it's in their interests to be polite to you. Patients know full well things cost and are less demanding as a result \n \nStaffing - much better support staff here who do obs before you see the patient and also handle the paperwork\n \nPatient numbers - I only see max 18 a day and that is rare. Get 40 mins - 1hr for physical and new patients and 20 mins for follow ups\n \n Disadvantage\n I would say main one is hassle with insurance companies but our support staff deal with that a lot and take away the burden. \n    submitted by    /u/fred66a  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I wrote 'see full medical records\n This was then queried, so i said can attach full medical record if the patient consents.\n But I feel this might have been the wrong advice. A) don't think should really be providing full medical records to insurance companies unless patients really request it B) think if so, would need to go through the notes and redact any 3rd party info. \n I'm not sure how to rectify this situation. It was only a few days ago - so i will ask team not to contact pt/release any info. And I can suggest that the form needs repeating.\n But I'm not sure how to complete the form.

So, just a bit of background, my fiancée (soon-to-be-wife next month!) works part-time remotely. Before I accepted my training post offer, her boss assured her she could go fully remote, just needed to make it official. However, the HR swooped in and declared, \"Nope, remote work? Not anymore!\" which apparently was following a recent change in policy. So, here I am, stuck at a trust four hours away from where she lives.\n Fast forward to February's transfer window. I applied for an inter-deanery transfer (criterion 4) and I got an email confirming my eligibility! But sadly, there weren't any vacancies in the receiving deanery.\n Now, here's the kicker. My current deanery covers two trusts. One, as mentioned, is a four-hour trek. The other is a delightful one-hour drive from my fiancée. So, armed with my \"eligible\" status from the inter-deanery drama, I confidently lodge an intradeanery transfer request which has the same eligibility criteria as the Interdeanery one. To my surprise, my request gets denied a few days later. According to them, my circumstances haven't changed AT ALL since accepting the post. Am I missing something here?!\n HELP!\n Sorry for the rant ! But this lack of clarity and flexibility is enough to make anyone question their career choices. So, any tips on navigating this ordeal before I lose my cool and possibly my desire to be a doctor? Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Dry-Conclusion3450  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not to mention that childcare finishes at 6 so I will likely also need some kind of wrap around childcare. \n Good thing we are renting and don’t need a mortgage because we will be using our savings to at least get me through training (though is that even worth it at this point?)\n Requested an IDT to facilitate life. Rejected. So I will be finding a childcare setting close to work and my husband will have to com…",

          "description": "I got married 2 years ago and changed my legal name to my husband's name, but decided I wanted to keep practising in my maiden name. I have a couple of publications, and also just didn't want to give up my maiden name altogether.\n I signed up for MRCP Part 1 earlier this year and, as per their advice, signed up for my online account using the name I am registered with on the GMC register, my maiden name. I believe you actually can't sign up for an account unless you do this.\n A few weeks before the exam, I got the email saying \"Dear Dr {Maiden name} please make sure you have ID ready to show at your exam...\"\n I emailed back explaining that all my ID (passport etc) is in my married name. They replied saying they had changed my name on the system to married name.\n I phoned up, and was told that they didn't have a way to hold 2 names in their database, so I should contact them again immediately after taking the exam to change my name back to my maiden name, and continue to continuously alternate changing my name back and forth before and after every exam I take through the College.\n I emailed again, calling them out on how ridiculous this is. In a world where many married women/people in same sex marriages practise in a maiden name, their systems are discriminating against these protected characteristics.\n They told me they had issued a \"discrepancy letter\" so that my name on the system would match my ID, but any certificate etc would have my maiden name, and match my GMC.\n Got my results today, and lo and behold....it has the wrong name on it.\n Anyone else had a similar experience? I feel so frustrated and let down, when so many others must be in this situation.

          "description": "This is a bit of a rant.\n F2 on psychiatry. It’s a good rotation overall as I see loads of interesting cases and it’s well supported.\n There is a PA on the team who is absolutely useless. He doesn’t do bloods or ECGs so I and the other FYs and CTs are doing such scutwork. He simply says it’s not his job to do bloods and ECGs. Doesn’t even have to scribe in those MDTs so the doctors are doing this as again he claims it’s not his job. Doesn’t even do discharge letters which can be done even from home as we get laptops so we doctors take turns working from home to clear discharge letter backlog. The only thing this PA wants to do is do patient reviews or clerking where obviously he cannot prescribe or do section 5(2) so additional work generated for doctors because he does an absolute shitty job so we end up clerking ourselves to cover our asses. In the hospital, nurses would be doing bloods and ECG. Told my consultant and he knows this is bad but nothing he can do as it was management’s decision \n Never seen a PA do scutwork even in hospital and saw one try to put in a cannula in an arrest and he was absolutely trash and it was obvious he hadn’t done a single one ever since he graduated from PA school and the anaesthetist leading the arrest told him to ‘get lost’ literally as he was deadweight (this PA does own endoscopy lists whilst the Gastro SpR does the firefighting on the wards)\n So you can see these people do not in anyway help our workload but instead do the very opposite and are clearly a liability with their lack of knowledge, skills and insight. Yet I see hospitals stop JCF recruitment and hire new PAs instead which even the consultants oppose but uneducated hospital management love them because they’re ‘cheaper’ and on paper looks like they have improved staffing but reality is that these people are deadweight and have only increased workload for the existing doctors who are held responsible for these deadweights. \n    submitted by    /u/xxx_xxxT_T  \n [link]   [comments]",

In a rush I glanced over the report and noted it said no PE, I reviewed the patient and they were a bit breathless. This had happened earlier in the day and they'd been given a smidge of oramorph so I did the same. I went to check up on the patient about 30mins later just because I had an uneasy feeling and the patient was GCS 3, basically not breathing so I put out the crash call and everything, they were DNACPR and after about 5mins the consultant stopped interventions because the patient had passed away. On reviewing the CTPA report it had said that the patients stomach was distended and full of fluids and NGT was recommended but I had missed this and hadn't put one in. The consultant thinks the patient likely aspirated vomit and died as a result. They've reassured me that any intervention when I'd initially seen the patient probably wouldn't have made much difference but I'm struggling to cope with the fact that I missed something that may have been able to prevent the patient dying.

Unfortunately I haven’t heard back after multiple attempts so I’ve asked the secretary to alert them to my emails. I usually would go see if I can find them in person but they work quite random shifts and I’m on nights this week so it’s harder for me. I am still going to try and find them in person this week though, even if it means ruining my sleep RIP, as I don’t know how else to get in touch. I don’t have their mobile number as they don’t give it out. I’m wondering if anyone has experienced this and what you would normally do in a situation like this. I’ve had this issue throughout the year with arranging meetings/obtaining sign offs from my ES and alerted the foundation programme coordinator who ignored my emails as well, lol :( My portfolio is up to date currently and in my last ES meeting they were happy with my progress with no concerns raised.

Instead she had to be aware of everything going on for 3hrs.\n \nShe reports that no one spoke to her during the 3h op, but it seems she's referring to the O&G team who were obviously trying to stem the bleeding. Surely the Anaesthetist spoke to her, but she doesn't mention this. Do people not think the Anaesthetist \"counts\" in this situation? \n \nShe was upset at how calm the paramedics where when taking her to hospital for her 2nd major haemorrhage. It appears they did everything appropriately and pre-alerted resus. It seems as though she wanted them to panic/be as distressed as she was, and she found their calmess synonymous for lack of compassion.\n \n It sounds like she had a harrowing experience, and there are reasonable points for why her emergency section was delayed when she had a meconium stained ROM (and was keen for section), why she didn't get a GA, why she was discharged without CT results being viewed, why she was discharged on routine analgesia despite it clearly not being effective.\n I really don't envy O&G/anaesthetic colleagues dealing with this, sounds awful by all accounts.\n    submitted by    /u/IndoorCloudFormation  \n [link]   [comments]",

Things are in motion for the move, I've ticked off pretty much all the required stuff for ARCP - but I don't have a QIP. This is not entirely for lack of trying; there have been a few things throughout the year that fell through/never took off, but I'd be lying if there wasn't also a large part of me that is hugely apathetic at the idea of doing a QIP for the sake of it when the majority of them never really seem to make any difference.\n ARCP is looming and I have diddly squat. I am concerned that as it is necessary for progression this will put a big stall on things. My partner has managed an inter-regional transfer to follow me. I have a meeting with my supervisor tomorrow and am sort of bricking it (returned to work yesterday after being away for significant life event). What does the hive mind advise?

One of the panelist has the Dr title used before their name, but they are not a medical Dr, they have a doctorate in something else. It doesn’t make that clear on the website afaik.\n  \nI’m firmly of the belief that in clinical settings Dr should only be used as an identifier for people with medical degrees, and anyone with a doctorate who wants to make it known should use a post-nomial like PhD etc. but not the title. \n \nI don’t know the etiquette at conferences in general, but shouldn’t this be the case at medical conferences that post-nomials are used to avoid confusion? And if identifying doctorates vs medical degrees with suffixes/post-nomials is the norm, how on earth did this slip?\n \nAdditionally one panelist discussed a need to increase training posts for radiographers but I don’t really think anyone mentioned anything about increasing training posts for radiologists despite the fact training posts were about 50 fewer this year than last year. \n  \nI have read this, but I still think it would’ve been sensible for them to discuss it given the title of the conference.\n \n  \nEdit: to be clear I’m not saying that PhD colleagues shouldn’t use the Dr title in non-clinical settings. I totally agree with what Bramsstrahlung said in the comments - they worked for it, they’re knowledgable and they deserve respect.

          "description": "In what appears to be an attempt to move as far in opposition to trainee feedback as possible my surgical department (read managers and admin staff who will never work a shift out of hours) have decided to move our whole surgical rota to an “ED Model” meaning 8am-5pm 4pm -1am 11pm -8.30 am. Personally and anecdotally the ED rota pattern was what decided me that I couldn’t do the job long term, but does anyone have any sources to hand about the impact of this kinds of rota, or any other points we’ve missed? Actual Data would be helpful if anyone does have any to hand? Mainly our feeling if that the reason this is sustainable in ED is that patients are (Theoretically) in and out of the department within one shift cycle, without repeated handovers of inpatients\n ​\n Current non clinical objections raised by trainees include, safety concerns walking home alone at night, impact on kids bedtimes/ family time with increased twilight shifts. Increased number of working weekends means impact on ability to see partners in other deaneries / cities, considering we are moved here as part of rotational training. \n ​\n Thanks everyone!\n    submitted by    /u/Pigeon-in-the-ICU  \n [link]   [comments]",

It feels like they are all anesthetic sho's. A few have even told me they don't really have any effective work in the first 30min -1 hr of the day, and just emails DURING THEIR WORK DAY!\n  \n. \n They always leave on time or slightly before 5 o clock. Literally none of them ever finished their job late or comes in early to deal with admin. This is clearly a lie.\n  \n3.Career development is paid for and time is compensated. They almost contribute no time to studying outside of the job, they don't have any portfolio. A few have been offered payed masters, while most have paid courses. \n  \nThey all get payed at least as much as me or much more.\n \nAll are impressed that I'm a doctor, even when I explain their life and job is objectively better than mine. Some even seem somewhat jealous. They look at being a doctor as an achievement while I see it as a bad job. This one is weird.\n \n In summary, it seems they have a lot of free time. One of them even told me \"You come back from work, then study in your free time? I think you have become used to being overworked\". Guys...I beginning to think I'm part of a sort of Truman show experiment. These other professionals must be trolling me. \n Normal jobs in other sectors cannot be this easy.

          "description": "Question for my psychiatric brethren from a confused F3. What's the benefit of diagnosing a well-functioning adult with autism? The person I have in mind regarding this has a large group of friends, is university educated, is doing well at his job, and has a host of interests and hobbies and frequently travels. \n And yet they're determined to get a diagnosis for autism for traits they feel they've had since they were young that were never \"picked up\". These traits include behaviours such as struggling in English as a kid, needing some sentences to be repeated once to process it, and failing at times to take into account the impact his actions have on others. From my view and very (very) moderate psychiatric experience, I thought it would be better to target the traits he feels are negative specifically and address those individually rather than connecting them together and saying \"these all are traits of autism therefore I have autism\". \n If someone has high blood pressure we diagnose them with hypertension and treat, likewise with depression. But autism seems too much of a spectrum to be a helpful diagnosis if there's no functional impairment.\n But am I approaching this wrong? Is there a benefit to getting an autism diagnosis that I'm missing when there's no demonstrable impairment in their day to day life? \n Your advice is appreciated and you're all absolute heroes! \n    submitted by    /u/DatGuyGandhi  \n [link]   [comments]",

If any of you docs are leaving what are you going on to do? I genuinely feel so deflated just now, who knew having a prestigious degree such as medicine in the UK would be treated like almost nothing. It really frustrates and upsets me, as a patient myself relying on good quality care from doctors it scares me to see what’s happening, I genuinely hope the government will see sense.

These should die down after Wednesday which is the date of the exam. \n A 48 year old woman comes to the rheumatology clinic for review. She has complained to her GP of multiple problems over the past few months including Raynaud's phenomenon, symptoms of reflux oesophagitis and stiffening of her fingers with tightness of the skin. On examination her BP is 155/90, HR is 78 bpm and regular. Heart sounds are normal and chest is clear. Her abdomen is soft and non tender and her BMI is is 22. You note a number of telangiectasia over her face and upper chest and those over her hands. The skin over her hands appears tight and thickened. \n Bloods were all normal except for a creatinine of 142 (NR 50-120). \n Which of the following autoantibodies is most likely to be found in this patient?\n Anti-topoisomerase 1\n Anti-centromere\n Anti-RNA polymerase III\n Anti fibrillarin \n Anti U11RNP \n I put the answer as anti centromere since this lady is showing CREST syndrome however the answer was anti-RNA polymerase III. The explanation said 'anti RNA polymerase antibodies are particularly associated with renal involvement in patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis. They are also associated with increased risk of scleroderma renal crisis and reduced risk of pulmonary fibrosis. The abnormal creatinine is a pointer towards RNA polymerase III activity.'\n I have 2 questions:\n  \nIs this limited or diffuse systemic sclerosis?\n  \nI always thought CREST syndrome was limited and renal/lung involvement was diffuse. \n  \nIf this is limited scleroderma, surely anti centromere would be more likely to be positive rather than anti RNA polymerase III? \n  \nThanks for the help. \n    submitted by    /u/CoconutFrequent8576  \n [link]   [comments]",

Seems like I will be taking another year out of training as I have not managed to get into my speciality of choice given the ridiculous competition for training spots this year. \n I am an agency locum (registered with ID Medical) working in London - have worked a total of 31 shifts only since the beginning of August. I have worked at multiple Trusts, basically just filling out the odd rota gap. The rest of my time has been spent working on some publications and travelling.. and applying for locum banks at my local hospitals (which I am still waiting to get on).\n The whole situation is an utter shitshow and I was not aware that I needed to complete an appraisal until I read a few posts on here a few weeks ago discussing this matter. My registration needs renewal in August and my appointed officer is some person I have never spoken to under my agency's umbrella.\n I think my agency can sort it out for £500+, but I am not sure whether I will require reflections for that process to take place. I guess I would really appreciate some advice (or some further information) on how to best manage this situation.\n Thank you very much for your patience and understanding. \n    submitted by    /u/WalkingCockroach  \n [link]   [comments]",

(78% in Written, 78% in OSCE, 79% in PSA)\n I am currently on a GP remediation placement post-finals as I missed the original placement pre-finals.\n On my first day of the placement recently, I got absolutely GRILLED by the main GP.\n He asked me questions such as 'Why does low vitamin D make us tired?' and then proceeded to explain how it is something to do with the calcium between muscle cells. I had no idea.\n He also asked me stuff like 'What is the use of cholesterol in the body?' and again I had no idea. He explained it is used to make testosterone etc.\n He grilled me for hours on end on pathophysiology and preclinical stuff and I was at placement with him at the practice till 8pm. It was a very humbling experience but it made me determined to learn and become a good doctor like him one day. He really inspired me a lot by his knowledge.\n He mentioned when I start FY1 I will have a license to kill and I need to make sure my knowledge is as good as it can be before then to make sure patients are safe.\n I'm going to be honest, over my 7 years at medical school (Yes, 7, I repeated a couple years due to mental health issues), I just studied to pass exams and get through the hoops, I just learnt the 'high yield' information.\n I don't remember ANYTHING from preclinical years at all and feel stupid. Even my clinical knowledge is starting to go away now we are 2 months post-finals...\n What can I do to be well prepared to look after my patients come August? I am starting on Cardiology. Please don't tell me to just relax - I want to do what I can to become a good doctor and be safe, even if it's just a tiny bit of reading.

          "description": "As the title suggests, I’m a psychiatry trainee with a major interest in psychotherapy and I’m becoming more and more disillusioned by the many flaws associated with psychiatry which I won’t get into right now. I know there’s the option of applying to medical psychotherapy, but it seems that even the most dedicated of trainees that I know are struggling to get a higher training job in it, hence why I’ve been thinking of just making the switch over to psychology. I’ll be taking up a specialty job as I consider my ST applications but with every passing day I find myself less and less interested in continuing on my current path and I’m not sure I have any more interest in being in the doctor role of the MDT. \n Does anyone know someone who’s made this switch? If there’s a particular pathway they followed? At this point I’m willing to hang my doctor hat up but would like to hear from anyone with experience of making a switch like this to see if they miss wearing said hat. \n    submitted by    /u/Odd_Royal_Danger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just wanted some advice because I'm too embarrassed to ask any colleagues I know in real life. \n Basically I (FY1) have a crush on a senior colleague (ST4) and I wanted to ask if it is appropriate to ask him out 😅. Just fyi he's only 5 years older than me and we dont work in the same department and I barely see him in the hospital we work at. He isnt involved in my arcp or anything linked to my progression to FY2. And I'm moving hospital for FY2. \n Ok, so a few more details:\n I worked with him briefly a few months ago and developed a crush and I kind of got the vibe he liked me too (he would always look at me and smile and talk to me etc).\n I don't really see him much at work because we're in different departments and the few times I've run into him since we've only said hi and smiled at each other. I'm super shy so I've never initiated conversation since we've worked together but I did email him about some case we saw together.\n I recently had someone in my family pass away and it made me realise how short life is and I don't want to regret not asking him if he may like me too. \n So basically, how do i do this in a non-creepy, non-weird and low pressure way so that if he doesn't feel the same then he can just say no and we can move on with our lives. \n Also is it weird for an Fy1 to ask a reg out? We are very very unlikely to work on the same team again and I'm almost 26 and he's 30/31 so I don't think we're in completely different stages in life.\n And what is an appropriate place to ask because obviously I'm not going to waltz into handover and ask or in the middle of a cardiac arrest. \n Also is this ok - what is the likelihood he's going to report me to the GMC and I'm going to be struck off before I even get fully registered (tbh i dont mind because the NHS sucks). And also worst case scenario, if he says no then that'll be the final push for me to run away to Australia after fy2. \n Also sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this 😅 \n    submitted by    /u/Petrichor_3  \n [link]   [comments]",

Other medications include ramipril 10mg and furosemide 40mg. His blood pressure is 124//84 and his pulse is 85bpm and regular. He has pitting oedema to the mid shins bilaterally and crackles to the midzones on auscultation of the chest. \n Bloods were all normal except for a mildly raised creatinine of 137 (NR 50-120).\n Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n Add epleronone 25mg \n Increase furosemide to 80mg \n Add indapamide 2.5mg \n Decrease bisoprolol to 2.5mg \n Stop bisoprolol \n I put the answer as add epleronone, since i thought it has prognostic beneefit in heart failure so will help his symptoms. However the answer was in fact to increase the furosemide. Is it because the main complaint is fluid overload rather than long term prognosis?

Does the normal MR mean he doesn’t have OA. \n Q2. Is OA therefore a radiological diagnosis? \n Q3.Or instead are the radiological changes of OA the result of years of OA like the radiological changes of RA are the result of years of RA? Overall is the inflammation caused by the degenerative changes or are the degenerative changes caused by the inflammation?\n Q4. If not OA what would you diagnose this pt with. Would you label it as fibromyalgia.\n 75F with chronic knuckle pain and very pronounced knuckle joints from bony prominence. 2nd MCPJs are the worst. Mother had a diagnosis of RA. Joints are thin and bony. No soft tissue swelling and patient denies ever having soft tissue swelling. OA changes in DIPJs and PIPJs, but no pain in those.\n Q5. Does the lack of any h/o soft tissue swelling rule out RA?\n Q6. If you don’t think so, if i did blds and got a negative RF and AntiCCP would that then be adequate to say that its just OA?\n Q7. If still no would an XR showing no erosive changes then rule it out?\n Q8. Is RA a well defined diagnosis? What I mean by this is if I sent this lady to 100 rheumatology consultants would they all give the same answer to the question does she have RA? I see patients with a diagnosis of RA being treated with mtx, with negative RF and antiCCP and no XR changes and no history of soft tissue swelling I wonder why was it diagnosed as RA?\n Thanks for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Hat3829  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to ask if anyone has taken some time out of training for personal reasons and then returned to their specialty afterwards. \n For a bit of background, I've had a big change of perspective recently. A lot of my family & family friends have become seriously/terminally unwell or passed away in their 50s. A big chunk of them were quite unhappy but were looking forward to a dramatic life changes in a retirement they will now never have. \n I really like my job. But if I'm honest with myself, I came straight from school and have never known any different. I have all these things that I want to do, experiance and see but don't know how I can do it whilst working the way we do. I've been saying to myself for a very long time \"Oh, I'll do all this when I'm [graduated/post foundation/bought a house]\" but now I realise - I've just been making excuses for not doing them because it's so inconvenient to take the time out. However, I can no longer comfortably sit around in pre-conception for 5/10/15 years when I might lose my health or my life at any point.\n So I'm wondering if anyone has taken a career break for personal reasons during their training and if so - what was the process like? How long did you take out and how easy was it to come back? \n If it makes a difference, I'm a CT2 in a specialty that does not have run through training (Anaesthetics).\n    submitted by    /u/UlnaternativeUser  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just wanted to ask for some advice on 30 minute consults in my FY2 GP rotation. \n Really struggling to stick to the 30 minutes, wanted to ask if anyone has any advice on getting faster without compromising too much? I'm just over a month now working in GP but only 2.5 weeks of doing my own consults as I had taken leave in the first month. Of course, I stick to getting the story right away but with the time needed to discuss cases I often end up later.\n I'm having about 80% of my actual history and exam end within 20-25 minutes but then have to see my senior to discuss. This often leads to going over the 30 minutes and an additional 10+ minutes more depending on if my senior is also with a patient. Unfortunately, this has a compounding effect and subsequent appointments then get later and later in the day. My practice prefers me to discuss each patient with them before seeing the next one (understandable).\n I feel like I'm not performing at the time efficiency expected of me, I also feel bad that patients often have to wait longer and longer as the day goes on.\n I've been aiming for 15-20 minute consult + 5 minute discussion + 5 minutes to write, but having a difficult time sticking to this.\n Any advice on how to structure my consults to be more time efficient would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/tom-gotchi  \n [link]   [comments]",

They did after doing only F1 in the UK. \n How easy would it be to move back to the UK after this? You might ask why anyone would ever want to, to which the answer is changing personal or family circumstance. \n (1) Would it be easy to get a UK consultant post as a US attending or would there be difficult hoops to jump through? \n (2) If you had both a UK training offer and a (significantly shorter) US residency offer in the same speciality, which would you take?

If you're a current or former trainee (especially at Reg level), or have connections to someone who is, I'd love your insights!\n Specifically, I'm curious about:\n  \nHospital logistics: How well does the unit function? What's the birth rate like? What are the call patterns and structure?\n Training environment: What kind of training opportunities are available? How's the relationship between juniors and seniors, and with consultants?\n Technology: Do they use paper notes or an EPR? Number of dedicated O&G theatres? Is CTG monitoring centralised (like K2/badgernet) or mostly still on paper like in many DGHs?\n Red Flags/Positives: Are there any potential concerns I should be aware of? On the flip side, what are some great things about working and training at Southend? \n Comparison: How does it compare to other hospitals in the EoE Deanery? Especially those closer to London (Luton/Watford etc.). Would also be interested to know how it compares to the rest of the Deanery as a whole though!\n  \nAny information you can provide would be incredibly helpful!

The idea that you'd take a year off after internship to locum has essentially died as migrants have filled all the RMO spots.\n Our training pathways are already bottlenecked and this burgeoning influx of migrants is only worsening the situation.\n Fair enough if you want to jump ship and settle in Aus, just keep in mind that the resentment will only grow as the shortage of training positions worsens and that by fleeing the UK you are essentially recreating the NHS shitshow in Aus.\n    submitted by    /u/BoringRelative238  \n [link]   [comments]",

The hospital is pretty nice, and I see my colleagues getting their contracts extended here and there. But with the saturation and all, I know for a fact that nothing can be taken for granted. My contract doesn’t expire before February of 2025, and I don’t wanna take chances. I’m applying for training in October. My CV is pretty good as it is, as I landed an IMT interview in the previous round. I’m working on improving it with my portfolio by applying for relevant courses (Ex: Got an ALS coming up very soon.) and conferences here and there, preparing for my MRCP early next year, doing audits, I already have a couple of finished audits and published researches and I’m in the middle of a research opportunity as a first author.\n I was wondering if there are any advises y’all can give to me to avoid ending up jobless by February of next year. For example, when to start applying for jobs, who do I need to give a good impression to (Aside from consultants, I assume.) in order to make sure I get my contract extended, etc…\n Again, I know nothing can be taken for granted, but I just wanna make sure I’ve done everything I can towards the situation, that’s all.\n    submitted by    /u/LifeIsButADream5343  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's with an a consultant I'm familiar with, but I know he's fairly keen. \n I've done my portfolio according to how it was explained to me when I had a training meeting with the trusts appraisal lead. My only objective is to keep practicing medicine safely and pass my exams. As my chosen specialty doesn't require an audit or QIP, I haven't done one. I've done a decent amount of CPD, but almost entirely of one type (passmed) which I have logged according to time spent studying. \n I'm just worried because a friend of mine got \"failed\" on their appraisal and the consultant refused to sign them off until they jumped through additional hoops. The Trust is also very keen on sending scary emails threatening GMC referrals if I don't submit on time.\n My understanding was that the appraisal isn't pass fail and the outcome should be to identify areas that need completing for next time, as opposed to being failed and having to submit additiona information.\n Am I wrong?,\n    submitted by    /u/ThatKetoneSmell  \n [link]   [comments]",

She completed FY1/2, then did a year of locum while applying for GP training. \n Now she has her training starting in August, I think.\n She asked me today if she could move in with me for 1-2 years, to save money. \n What I want to know is, is GP trainee pay so ridiculously low that she won’t be able to save in London? \n She’s currently paying around 1K in London for a small studio including bills. And has an old car as well that she uses for work. As well as student loan repayments etc. \n I don’t really know how much she earns, but she says that this GP trainee position will probably pay as much as the FY2 because in FY2 she had long days and nights of work and overtime etc.\n Is this really the case that a doctor training to be a GP in London is this skint? Or can just get by without saving much?? \n Would appreciate your input since I’m not a doctor and not in medical field either. \n EDIT - I have already googled but want to know if the net pay is so low that it’s only a tiny bit more than FY2 because it’s only 9 to 5. I don’t know if she’s careless with money or to believe her because it just seems crazy to me. She claims if she lives with me she can save and without it she would struggle. \n    submitted by    /u/ThrowRA8374738  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like it a lot and gradually growing on me even though in the first week I had marked myself as bad at anaesthetics when it is just a specialty with a very steep learning curve and it’s difficult to be bad at Anaesthetics as F2 because the expectations are literally on the floor (even CT1s who I look at like seniors are treated much the same) and they seem way too impressed that I even read about physiology and pharmacology to better understand what I am seeing. And they’re all nice people (except a few). I like to get stuck in with cannulas but a lot of the time they seem to want to do it themselves so not getting as much practice as I was hoping but I have gotten better at least even if I am not the cannula god yet so can’t complain. Best FY job so far \n I have ICU next where I am supernumerary and people say I will get to do more stuff there so looking forward to ICU. Always a consultant present and they want you to run everything by them so it looks like I will have fun there\n But I haven’t had the opportunity to do any US guided cannulas, arterial lines (have seen them being put in), or other procedures so far as art lines anaesthetists want to do themselves because we only get one go at it in theatre. If the anaesthetist is requiring US then they’re definitely not gonna let me even come close to having a go so I just watch. I was wanting to be very good at cannulation including US guided but doesn’t look like I will be excellent by the end of anaesthetics even if substantial improvement\n Will I get more cannulation opportunities in ICU (very useful skill to have)?

I've picked up a few complex housebound patients by virtue of being the trainee who is first in line for a visit, sent one of them in today in an ambulance ?MSCC, (less of a ? And more of a \"I'll eat my stethoscope if its not\") It was a difficult visit due to the fact I know him and his wife very well, they're struggling already, and this was a shock. Few other complex medical bits today and just a standard non stop GP day for the rest. \n As a result I've woken up almost every hour since I fell asleep having had very vivid work realted dreams, always interesting to see what weird and suprisingly medically accurate scenarios my subconscious can come up with. I had a really nice evening, chatted to some friends/family, made a nice dinner, played with the dog, thought I'd decompressed fairly well but obviously not!

Occupational health have recommended some reasonable adjustments to return to work - namely coming off of on calls for six months and a phased return over 8 weeks. I’m wondering if anyone can advise how this might affect pay and whether pay is protected at the same level as before I went on sick leave during this phased return, as it is a temporary change/reasonable adjustment? I’ve heard varying things from the trust I work at, and would be in a difficult position if my pay were to be cut especially as my employer will not let me work full time or do on calls currently. I’ve contacted the BMA and I’m waiting to hear back. I’m just wondering if there are any resources that I can refer to before contacting HR?

He had a complete white out of his lung, but was surprisingly well and saturating 94% on air with only SOBOE. I made the argument that the patient may need medical management for his ALD rather than a chest drain, but the consultant insisted I do it saying that it will either be me or IR who do the drain.\n I took the patient to the resus unit and preped everything. I had a quick look at the lung with the ultrasound then inserted the drain with ultrasound guidance. It all went relatively smoothly, but I noticed the patient was draining a lot (unsurprisingly).

Im a current F1 and ive made 60k this year pre-tax. I live a pretty good life. I actually want to do surgery but would give that up if i moved to the States. \n Ive spoke to a friend of mine who is ST6 in surgical sub-speciality (not gensurg/neurosurgey type) and he says you can comfortable clear 6 figures in reg years by locuming - especially if NROC. Which then rises to around 200-220k as a consultant with NHS + PP. \n My question is basically:\n  \nHow important is money beyond 100-150k (my partner is also a doctor so x1.5-1.6 as she will go LTFT). \n \nWould any surgeons here give up surgery to make 3x the money in a procedural speciality in the states. \n \nI have all my family here - both parents are doctors and dad is 70% private in a high earning speciality clearing around 350.

Not only is this situation mortifying, but it's also becoming a topic of discussion among my colleagues.\n I've tried to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, considering dietary habits, stress levels, and even possible gastrointestinal issues, but to no avail. It's as if the elevator itself triggers this bizarre auditory association.\n I turn to you, my esteemed peers, for any insights or advice you may have on how to address this peculiar predicament.

I'm just wondering since I'm an IMG and have no ties whatsoever in the UK, the only reason why I still consider staying in the UK is the absolute pain of getting a new visa, again. Though my UK HR has been pestering me to send the documents over so they can start the visa renewal process.\n ​\n NGL, the pay in Australia is better though. I'll be working in ED in both hospitals.\n    submitted by    /u/alliedwithmysoul  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have got nothing against EU graduates but this is injust for every other IMG and UK graduate that have to sit this exam. Also the competency level of communicational and practical aspects of medicine from EU graduates seems to be lacking due to the profound levels of so called 'Taught in English' programmes in some countries where in reality it is far from taught in english and ideally require the original language to have a just of clinical years. Also I really don't understand how the UK government is just accepting what the EU is telling them to accept with no refute whatsoever, I suppose brexit but seriously.\n May come as a hate post for EU graduates but I sincerely don't mean it in that way, also this post is just of conception and I am not keen on making this my identity of having to introduce the ukmla for EU graduates lmao.

Assuming I'm given it, how does the process of choosing a specific hospital work?

          "description": "I'm thinking of setting up a med ed course & wanted some suggestions. \n Most specialty applications require 2 days of training in teaching methods. These usually cost £200+ & I'm not sure I've always found them to be the most helpful when looking at their content. I'm also keen that these things should be free as it's expensive enough getting into specialty training. \n I'm thinking of building an e-learning course with some virtual face to face content (to meet the criteria of CST applications, but also to discuss project ideas and get feedback). I'd be running it with my experience of setting up medical education projects locally, regionally & nationally through Mind the Bleep. The team at Mind the Bleep is made of over 200 doctors now - so plenty of people to provide expertise. \n The content I'm thinking to cover would include - Briefly educational theory with a focus on what matters in the real world - Overview and practicalities of how to set up/organise or run the different types of medical education (bedside, tutorial and small group teaching, lectures, simulation, webinars, e-learning courses & websites) including curriculum, assessment, feedback & teaching methods \n I'd love some advice. My worries are - There won't be formal external accreditation. This costs upwards of a thousand pounds which isn't feasible. That doesn't mean it won't help & CPD accreditation doesn't appear to be necessary on any portfolio - Utility of this programme as I really want to create something that is useful to people teaching. Is this the content people want? Will it be used & so worth the enormous time & effort we'll have to put in to create this? \n    submitted by    /u/MindtheBleep  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know a lot of this will be dependent on my personal circumstances but if anyone has any experiences of following either path and can offer reassurance/caution then it would be most appreciated! \n I am an EM ST3 runthrough trainee struggling with mental health secondary to work and have therefore lost passion for it which I did have at the beginning of ST3. I like EM and want to continue working in it in the future. Plan to finish ST3 but a bit stuck about what to do after this. Current state of burnout/depression is likely a long term build up with a couple of specific incidences that put me over the edge. \n Options as I see it are to continue training dropping down to LTFT and trying to push for some sort of career break (which i've been told is unlikely given i wouldn't do something clinical). As a run through trainee, knowing it would be hard to get back as an ST4 in my region if I left, this seems like a sensible option but the thought of continuing training doesn't do anything for my sense of apathy/low mood. \n Or drop my number and locum (i am financially dependent on work and don't have an option to not work) with a plan to trust grade/CESR in the future. The idea of a break and having some control over things makes me feel great but I'm nervous about the uncertainty/isntability this introduces going forward with my career. \n I am doing everything i feel is needed to address mental health (counselling/occy health) and my department are aware of these issues/have offered time off if i feel like this is what i need. \n Thanks in advance (on nights sorry if i don't reply to people quickly) \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/LiveMiddle7891  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve asked them to add more vegetables and it’s seldom there. When patients don’t eat food, it goes to the bin. When the cafe food doesn’t get eaten, it gets “recycled” I.e. compost, and there’s a sign on the table proudly declaring that all food goes to compost. They charge an extortionate amount for the disgusting food and chuck half of it away. \n Why does NHS waste so much food and why can’t they give us food, even if it’s just the left overs. Half the time on evening shifts there are no cafes open. How could they expect us to work hungry. I just don’t get how inhumane these trusts are. Yet 2 billion to spend on a stupid app is ok. But food for staff is not ok. \n    submitted by    /u/PuzzleheadedAd9422  \n [link]   [comments]",

Light green- that’s yellow to me. ( the cheese and onion Lays - crisp i’m still confused whether it’s yellow or Green, you can google it. i hope, you must have guessed my country now!! )\n This is my very first post in Reddit, i eventually will inform the GMC during my GMC registration. I felt whenever we say inform DVLA to patients ( well, OSCE scenario ) that hurts me, because in my back of the mind, i wanted to avoid this to GMC. But not anymore, I decided to inform them! \n It’s not my fault having a faulty glorious X gene! \n The purpose of this post is, if any fellow colleague/ if anyone knew anyone who has mentioned about CB during the GMC registration, i want to know how they proceed? Any tests? Any precaution!\n During my MBBS and Post-graduation in back home, i had to undergo a special screening in ophthalmology which was fun! I’m eager to know what the GMC do, usually!!\n Thank you. Looking forward for everyone’s inputs!\n PS: my speciality of interest is Internal Medicine, Cardiology!! \n And i couldn’t edit the wrong spelling for the word Colour above!

The patient had ongoing central crushing chest pain.\n Apart from patient having normal obs and known significant cardiac history I wasn't able to do much. Nearest crash trolley was also far away and I did the only thing that made sense to me at the time and took the patient to ED.\n I told the nurse in charge that the patient needs assessment and if they have no emergency needs I'm happy to admit the patient to the medical team.\n I got a call from the ED consultant a little while later and they were angry I hadn't discussed this with them and did not want to discuss this with me. Instead told me they are putting this patient on the medical list. When I explained that this might not be safe/ appropriate. They got angry and insisted they were the consultant and I'm the reg so I must listen. They won't engage with me and only wanted to speak to my consultant.\n My consultant also said the same thing as I did.\n Patient was completely fine. all bloods/ ecg/ xray normal. patient got sent to the ambulatory services (I asked nurse to refer to the ambulatory service) and eventually discharged.\n the ED consultant has written an email to my supervisor stating my 'rudness was a serious matter' and that he wants to be kept updated as this is something he feels he should refer to the GMC - not verbatim because I can't remember the details of the email.\n I'm confused about this reaction. a little worried about the potential GMC complaint.

How are fresh graduates expected to compete with those that have had numerous years collecting points for self assessment scores and examination prep from abroad?\n Even if the government tripled the training places overnight.

The new deanery does things a bit differently and some of my upcoming rotations will require me to do med reg cover of the hospital at night. The hospital doesn't have the big cardio/resp/gastro wards but has a wide selection of miscellaneous medical and surgical specialities.\n While on paper I have all the requisite skills (MRCP, ALS, see a lot of acutely unwell inpatients in haematology) I feel quite anxious about being the medical point of call for the hospital given it has been about 5 years since I did any \"proper\" general medicine.\n Has anyone been in a similar position and/or have some advice on how to effectively refresh med reg skills? I'm aware I'm probably overthinking it, and there is a genuine med reg at a neighbouring hospital I could call if I'm stuck, but I'd like to go into it feeling vaguely prepared!\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Group2Fast2Furious  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had no idea if I could say yes and suddenly not be at work or if I would be in trouble for saying yes and having the surgery.

          "description": "Recently had an ES meeting with review of a MSF/TAB type feedback. Vast majority globally positive and complimentary. However multiple references to, and 2 \"needs improvements\" on approach to risk/acting beyond my grade (core anaesthetics). We discussed the basis of this. There was one incident which was an objectively stupid decision made in the heat of the moment - I won't detail much but involved taking my eye off the ball and increasing risk. No patient harm arose (fortunately) and the case progressed uneventfully, no SI/datix, but ES rightfully described as \"a really big cock-up\", \"it makes me concerned you haven't grasped the risks of anaesthetics\". Other than this incident feedback seemed to relate to how I come across rather than any specific incident. \n The stupid decision in question was some time ago and my ES seemed relieved at how much I'd reflected on it immediately after and since and my ownership of my mistake. Said just not to make it a pattern and all should be ok. I am accepting of feedback and strive to improve. \n Generally in life I am someone who can just make stupid mistakes in a variety of settings \"in the moment\" and regret them intensely after. I have been humbled by this and other dicey anaesthetic experiences (where there was no question at all that I had acted completely appropriately). I believe I am good at recognising risk before and after things and will counsel patients appropriately, ask for senior help at the first whiff of risk. What I'm looking for is advice on how to be better at making good clinical decisions in the moment and intuitively minimising risk, a quality I want to work on.

I took the cascard and looked at triage notes which said patient had taken X painkiller 2 hours ago and is allergic to Y and Z pain killers. I said, that limits my options as to what I can give. My colleague, who is more experienced, said prescribe C painkiller. I asked the nurse if the patient was allergic to it or if there were any contraindications, nurse said no. I prescribed it and asked her to double check with patient before giving it. (I did not know the allergy box on the cascard was not signed). \n I finished my shift and went home. Later that day the sho that was with me called me to inform me that the patient had stridor after the medication was given and became unconscious. Medical team were called who gave her adrenaline and prophylactic intubation and ITU. The patient’s vitals were normal throughout. The patient’s partner was called who said the same incident happened to her with the same medication a few months prior. An incident form was filled out. \n The next day the patient was extubated. Imaging normal and she self discharged. \n The nurses are saying that they informed the patient of the name of the medication before giving it to her and she accepted it (have not witnessed this myself though)\n I’m glad the patient is alive and well and I’ve spent many days going over what I should and should not have done and how I could have prevented this. Currently I’m extremely worried about what could happen and what the investigation can lead to. \n No one has emailed me yet about the incident report. Should I add it to form r\n Can anyone please advise.\n Thank you \n    submitted by    /u/Anxious_Bid2471  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would you ask them prior to each job you apply for or would it be acceptable to put them down for multiple applications if they have agreed once? Because trac jobs are asking for three years’ worth of references, I have to include a reference for a job I did over 18 months ago, and I feel so bad asking repeatedly for references but also have had a bad experience where I used a consultant twice for a reference and they emailed saying they only agreed to be a referee once (not the current consultant, this was from an F1 job). Is it the case with JCF jobs that they only send out reference requests once they have short listed you / interviewed you (if this is the case then I can give the consultants a heads up closer to the time). If anyone who’s applying currently / anyone who’s a consultant who’s getting reference requests could give me input advice, please it would be really appreciated, thanks in advance! \n    submitted by    /u/IllustriousSet878  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I an Emergency doctor, and I have seen this practice in the UK where we start IV fluids ( sometimes in a big amount ) for most patients with AF, unless they are clinically overloaded, as a method of rate control alone, and even in the overloaded subset of patients, IV fluids would be given but cautiously. I have tried in the past to challenge this practice as I believe that the main treatment for the stable rapid AF in the ED is rate control and try to search for the underlying cause, and I would only administer IV fluids if the patient is septic or dehydrated, otherwise, I don't see any benefit from overloading a possibly tired heart with more load to deal with in a euvolemic patient. Unfortunately I have always been put down when I tried asking about how IV fluids alone would benefit these patients. I am not sure on the validity of this practice snd I thought I might be on the wrong side so I have tried to seek its justification but couldn't find sufficient evidence. I also found this practice very common in a lot of EDs in the UK.\n Does any one have any insight on this practice being correct or not?\n    submitted by    /u/Miserable-Seesaw8614  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What?\n We need to take action against the General Medical Council and their anti-doctor agenda. By endorsing MAP expansion, they are undermining the medical profession and risking patient safety. However, unregistered medical practice is illegal, and unless the BMA coordinates a campaign, we must continue to pay GMC registration fees. \n The GMC encourages doctors to pay registration fees by direct debit. Direct debits have the lowest admin burden for the GMC and low transaction fees. \n Essentially, if you pay via direct debit, the GMC keeps more of your money and has to spend less on processing the payment.\n However, the GMC allows you to pay your registration fee by other methods:\n  \nCredit/debit card\n Cheque\n Postal order\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6niyr3k8zxc1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=7041dc4cf411d8967c4901c072371d9f1af2b7c4\n So what?\n These other payment methods will cost the GMC more to process and administer. \n Card payments are associated with higher payment processing fees. Cheques and postal orders will require more administrative staff to manage and process them.\n Mass cancellation of direct debits would send a message to GMC management, and may force them to acknowledge the strength of feeling amongst the medical profession.\n However, you would need to remember to pay via these other methods - one advantage of direct debits is that they are automated.\n Now what?\n We're open to any suggestions you have about this idea. This would require a coordinated campaign to raise awareness and encourage doctors to switch their GMC payment method.\n We have considered alternative options, but withholding GMC fees is only feasible if the BMA backs a campaign and provides protection for doctors. The GMC removes doctors who do not pay fees from the medical register, so you won't be able to work. They'll also inform the police if you continue to practise medicine!\n DefundtheGMC\n    submitted by    /u/defundthegmc  \n [link]   [comments]",

That’s why I have decided to reach out to you for advice. \n Little Background information:\n I have just completed my 3rd year in Dentistry in Scotland. My girlfriend whom I’ve met at uni is just completing her first Foundation Year down in England. I am trying to find out about her career options, in order to figure out how we can end up living and working in the same place again. We both have EU passports if that is of any help. \n I am completely new to this, and that is why I have a lot of questions. I will appreciate any help and advice. \n What are the career options for medics straight out of foundation year program? \n How does one enter specialty training after completing FYP? What are the requirements? Do you have to complete Medical core training first? Can you pick the place you want to do your specialty training or are you allocated to it randomly? Can you start your specialty training in one city and finish it in a different one? Should you go into specialty training straight after finishing FYP or is it better to gain some experience working first? \n Working abroad:\n What are common destinations for medics to work abroad, having finished medicine in UK? Where in EU is it possible for UK doctors to work? If you want to complete specialty training in EU or move forward with your medical career, do you have to speak the national language, or are there countries where you will just be fine with English? I am aware lots of medics end up moving to Australia. What does enrolling into specialty training programme for a UK do it or look like in Australia? Is it feasible? \n I am aware it’s a lot of questions, but I would be grateful for any help! \n    submitted by    /u/IntelligentTalk8419  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, was hoping that someone here would be able to give me some advice/guidance.\n I'm a final year medical student due to start working as an FY1 doctor in July/August this year. I unfortunately didn't get the region/group that I wanted within my deanery, but had been coming to terms with this (my partner and friends all got their top choice region).\n Whilst contacting one of the trust administrators for a different issue, they advised me that one of my rotations within my FY1 year has changed (to a less desired one for me), and also that my job is a GP LIFT programme, where I will have to work a day a week in a local GP practice.\n The LIFT aspect wasn't advertised anywhere in the ranking process or individual job description; when I told them this, they told me that the individual programme code (being FPP instead of the standard code) indicated this despite it not being mentioned that this was the case anywhere, nor was there any other evidence of this elsewhere. \n I don't particularly want to do the LIFT aspect and would much rather do the normal programme as it was advertised to me. Overall the randomised job allocation process has affected me quite negatively and now this is just another aspect which feels completely out of my control. \n I've contacted the BMA about this but they advised me that my trust is acting as mandated per my deanery, and that because the deanery is not directly an NHS employer they are not obligated by law to engage with the BMA; therefore the BMA cannot help me with this. \n Is there anything I can do about this? If so, how should I go about doing it? Any advice would be much appreciated as I've found this whole process quite overwhelming and I'm not sure where to go from here.

          "description": "As the title suggests I’m not in a good place at the moment. I am on my last F1 rotation and still feel like I’m drowning each day I go in to work. I’ve taken a month off and being treated for anxiety and depression. I’ve spoken to my supervisors and they have not been very supportive. My clinical was very flippant and made me feel less than. \n No one seems to understand how difficult I find adjusting to new rotations every four months and how only having my first medical job now - psych, surgery, medicine - means I feel grossly underprepared and under confident compared to my colleagues. On this new rotation I’m expected to see my own patients on ward round and there are no reg’s to ask advice. I understand how this may be realistic for approaching the end of F1 but I feel I’ve drawn the short straw having never seen medical patients independently until now. So I spend the whole day doubting my decisions and when I get home I’m usually tearful or just numb. I don’t have any friends or colleagues in F1 to talk to I am so alone. \n As F2 approaches I do not feel ready - part of me is relieved at my ARCP likely being extended due to illness and not meeting portfolio requirements. I think about alternative careers every single day as I have not enjoyed one day of F1. But I feel like a failure contemplating leaving what I’ve worked so long for. It’s to the point where I’m having frequent passive thoughts of ending my own life.\n I’ve had advice to continue and pursue a career in psychiatry - which I am interested in but the thought of another year of hospital medicine is daunting. \n Has anyone felt like this and kept going? Any experience with mental health and ARCP being extended? Should I leave now? Any other advice at all would be appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/Throwaway_84856  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can't get study leave for a course for the same reasons even after a request for cover from my ES. The rota coordinator and everyone else I need to interact with on an admin side either feels incompetent or malicious. It just feels like everything I try to do gets denied and there's no point in even trying anymore, they might as well allocate my leave for me. I genuinely don't know what they get paid for other than saying computer says no.\n I don't have a job lined up for next year, didn't want to have to go straight into specialty training but don't think I would've got in anyway. Every med ed post or JCF that I've applied to I've been rejected from without even a chance at interview because so many people with MRCP/MRCS are applying.\n I genuinely love being a doctor when I get to do my job and I don't even care about the pay anymore. I just want to feel the tiniest bit valued or respected instead of used and abused. I can't leave the country or move easily as I have a partner that is stuck in their job for the next 2 years and I just don't know where the light at the end of the tunnel is.\n Is there any way that I've missed to try to get my leave approved?

Surely it can’t be good to have brain abscesses and bleeds waiting for hours and hours when they’re Cat 1 cases? \n Is it that there’s no funding for more consultant posts or are the current consultants ladder pulling because there’s so little private work to corner? Just speculating here sorry. \n I know we all moan when referring to neurosurgery as you’ve got an ill patient with intracranial pathology who may or may not need intervention, but the poor neuro reg is filtering referrals from all these other DGHs in between cracking open craniums.

In my opinion the real doctor replacement role in the UK is ACPs and not PAs but I don't know why everyone is so afraid and shying away from saying this. I heard a consultant tell a trainee acp in the midst of doctors that when she qualifies that there is nothing a doctor can do that she won't be able to do legally except signing death certificates, that it would even change soon.😳😳\n So dear doctors, the only thing that makes you and I different from ACPS is that we can sign death certificates and cremation forms\n An ACP can pick up doctor locums as well as nurse/pharmacy, OT, physio locums as the case may be. Why are we not pretending like ACP is not a better thing to be instead of a non consultant doctor. Why are we not talking about the major threats to our profession, PA is a minor threat but ACP is a major threat. \n    submitted by    /u/Impressive-Art-5137  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Would really appreciate some advice on this please. I am a medic applying for a group 1 specialty and would like to go LTFT (80%) for specialty training for mental health reasons. \n Without going into too much detail, I have done all of my training so far full time, but the last couple of years of IMT were a real struggle and whilst I managed to finish without any sick leave, I was very close to not being alive at multiple points. My IMT TPD was not really aware of any of this - there were some wellbeing concerns raised at one point but they were put down to other issues, and I think most colleagues would be very surprised if they found out about my diagnosis (and just to be very clear, there have never been any concerns about me clinically and my MSFs/WPBAs have always been very good). I am doing better now and have good support in place, however, because of how bad things got during IMT, and because the nature of my illness means I am likely to get unwell again, I really want to work LTFT in order to try and have some breathing space should things start to go south again. \n My question is, how much of the above should I disclose to my TPD when discussing my LTFT application? Should I tell them my diagnosis and how bad things got? I really want to make the most of HST because I missed out on loads of opportunities during IMT because of my mental health, and if there is support they can give such as allowing me to go LTFT, I really want to make the most of it, but equally, I don't want people to be prejudiced because of my diagnosis. Or even worse, not believing me because I have managed to work full time so far (I can provide evidence of my issues though as I have letter from Practitioner Health etc.). \n I would be grateful for some advice regarding this from anyone who has been through something similar (or from anyone consultants who have been on the other end). \n    submitted by    /u/Tasty_Discipline_102  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was a patient who was referred to us on non-rebreath and in deteriorating T1RF. The bay only had 1 oximetry. The nurse assistant was doing her obs round at the time. While I was reviewing the patient with the reg, I asked the NA if I can borrow the machine. The NA told me to get my hands off the machine and I am not allowed to use the machine. At the moment, I couldn’t be asked to care about what she was saying. So I apologised to her and explained that this was a critically unwell patient (no pun intended). Then I took the machine to attend the patient. After our review, the charge nurse had a go at me… essentially chastising me for being condescending to the NA. She also threatened to notify my ES. After years of service in the NHS, passing exams, playing the portfolio game, it frustrates me to say this…but I dislike where we are as modern day doctors. \n    submitted by    /u/StrongPassion3366  \n [link]   [comments]",

A while later the investigation was closed with no further action, I was never arrested or charged.\n I'm now in the process of applying for registration with the GMC, and found out this is something I'm obliged to disclose to them. I am seeking legal advice.\n I hadn't considered this incident in a while. In hindsight, I feel as if the university didn't properly investigate me, I just got a few offers of support and nothing really ever came of my disclosure. This was an extremely stressful time of my life, I was just happy at the time that the university were not hounding me. I'm now concerned that I didn't contact exactly the right people or inform them of precisely the right things. I'm worried that this will result in me being withheld registration so that I can be investigated.\n I informed my university of the fact that I was the subject of a police investigation and was to be interviewed at the time. I did this via my tutor and university welfare team, and clearly stated I was a medical student, I have evidence of this. However, I didn't specify what I was being accused of, and was never asked. I have some limited evidence that I informed my tutor that I was specifically being interviewed under caution, but it's not airtight.\n I was just hoping for people's views on: 1) If I should have been more explicit/ done anything differently informing my university at the time and 2) how likely I am to be withheld registration.\n Thank you for your opinions in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/aioetiapnwfaa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm very grateful to get into training, especially considering the tight competition for SHO posts.\n However, even though I've accepted the post, I'm still considering moving to Australia. Since I'm from Asia, Australia is definitely closer than the UK, making it easier to travel home for emergencies.\n The only thing holding me back is the requirement to work in a non-training post for over a year before applying for Australian training programs, as I understand PR is necessary. Additionally, I'm unsure about the competitiveness of getting into GP or IMT in Australia.\n Therefore, I'm debating whether to commit to the GP training program for the next three years until CCT before moving to Australia.\n I'd love to hear from people who have recently moved to Australia post-CCT or after FY2 for their insights. Thank you very much!\n Edit for additional info:\n The reason I chose GP training here in the UK is because it was the shortest route to CCT. But I'm actually unsure if I want to become a GP. Does anyone know if getting into IMT is super difficult for IMGs in Australia?\n    submitted by    /u/Acceptable_Roll3482  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've had some wellbeing issues raised from others (mainly they can see my mood is low/I catastrophise when anything goes wrong or I feel like I've done a bad job). They've spoke to my supervisor who has spoken to me and I'm going through CBT for this and regularly checking in with my supervisor who has been very supportive. \n I found out from my supervisor (they knew this already but didn't mention anything till I mentioned the issues, think they were waiting till I was in a better headspace maybe) one senior trainee raised patient safety concerns. My supervisor agreed I should speak to the senior trainee to get a better idea of what happened. I think these were mainly related to a couple procedures a month or two ago in which they asked if they could take over as I'd tried for a while and things weren't working - I said I wanted the usual one more go for around maybe a minute or so then accepted defeat. The main reason I was hesitant was I didn't want to look incapable and handing it over meant that would go down as a failure. No harm came to the patients as far as I know anyway. I spoke to the senior trainee today but they just said I should speak again to my supervisor and said their main focus was patient safety. Made me feel like crap for sure as I'd hate to be unsafe and always have this fear. Prior to this never had any issues like this raised.\n I'll speak to my supervisor again and see about more details. I'm wondering if anyone has advice about managing this, how to get over this feeling of worry and I guess that concern about feeling safe- there doesn't seem to be any concern from my supervisor and I'm still on rota working independently etc if this makes a difference.

Clinical experience (no matter what specialty) makes us better clinicians and more well-rounded doctors, and I don't think anyone should be penalized for that. It's wild to me that if a consultant decides to retrain in another specialty, they have to drop down to an ST1 salary. There is no other career that requires its professionals to decrease their salaries in order to train. \n Is pay protection something we should be pushing for? Is the BMA looking into this?

          "description": "I’m a final-year medical student, starting F1 in August. In my last few weeks of placement, I’ve started wearing a bit of makeup in the hospital. \n When I say makeup, I just mean some basic foundation, mascara, bit of blush, bit of eyeshadow, nothing particularly striking. Basically what I would put on if I was going out for a meal with friends or maybe an informal date. However, what has been striking is the very noticeable difference in how I’m treated. I’m always keen and try to be enthusiastic, so normally after a couple of days of turning up for things the docs will be relatively nice and friendly to me, but it’s definitely only after ‘proving’ myself. Totally fair enough, they get lots of med students passing through. By contrast, I feel like I’ve been treated better and felt welcomed from the get-go. Not many concrete differences that I could point to, mainly just warmer tone and body language, although one of the docs even offered to talk me through a procedure rather than me having to ask. \n Now, I’d love to believe that everyone is just a bit nicer here, but realistically I know I look prettier with a bit of makeup and let’s be honest, pretty privilege is real and it seems like it’s at least a contributing factor to being treated differently. Anyone else experienced this whilst working? I know it varies significantly from team to team as so whether most people wear makeup or not - what’s the standard practice in your department? \n I don’t really desire to wear makeup every day but if it means I’m likely to be treated that much better as an F1 then I think I’ll have to…\n    submitted by    /u/LilacPuddle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have got a new job in Hastings. My wife is working in Hammersmith, London. We are planning to move to some place which is feasible for both of us commute wise. Sevenoaks ( somewhere near to the train station) is one of the places we are considering. Can my fellow Redditors please shed some light on Sevenoaks or suggest some other places as well ? \n Only cons of Sevenoaks I think is that her commute ( train+tube ) would be somewhat around £550 per month \n Some key facts: I have a car and I drive. My wife doesn’t drive. She uses trains/tubes/busses. She occasionally works night shifts as well. I want her commute to be as short as possible and willing to drive upto 80 mins each side to&from my world place \n All input highly appreciated, thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Big_Advantage6367  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got advice about contacting the BMA but they weren't helpful at all so I gave up. My trust referred the consultant to the GMC and I reported him to the police. I don't want to doxx myself but the police enquiry wasn't successful for a variety of reasons I can't go into.\n The investigation with the GMC was very thorough and they took multiple statements from me. It was extremely scary going to the hearing (I gave evidence both virtually and in person) but the tribunal members were very respectful. They did ask some inappropriate questions but they just needed to clarify I did not behave in a way that warranted him to touch me. \n He ended up getting erased from the medical register. I've not had any contact with him apart from the hearing and I'll be moving to a different deanery at the end of F2 so will be able to put everything behind me.\n I've also been in therapy since the incident and have healed in lots of ways. I've spoken with a lot of colleagues and it is surprisingly common but very few doctors report it. I hope that if someone can relate then they will have some hope that the system can protect you.

Due to the strikes, locum budgets have been slashed. PAs and ACPs will ofc be used as replacements for doctors in all but name. \n If you haven't entered training, or already got a JCF lined up, the next year of unemployment (because that's what a locum F3 is) will be scary. \n Try to get on as many banks as possible and join locum agencies. Good luck guys. \n In my opinion, it's better to enter training in something you have 0 interest in and at least pay the bills than risk locumming. Of course there will be some work, but you may go weeks / months without any stable work. This will not be comfortable. \n Our progression is so low. The F3 used to be a mini lucrative break that we'd get from the hell of foundation year, and now the current generation of foundation docs will lose out on that. Many of us used F2 to buy a home or pay for weddings. \n It is now more important than ever to get FPR and to also become much more protectionist with our profession - stop training ACPs/PAs that just ultimately kill the locum and job market for us. \n Strike hard \n    submitted by    /u/DNARplz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So it turns out our strikes were just rookie strikes.\n In South Korea, the government recently announced a plan to increase the number of medical students as a means to provide more doctors to serve the rural population.\n Current doctors and medical students said that this would not help because actually it is the poor working conditions and facilities in the rural areas that discourages doctors from going there, and also high levels of litigation. It is also likely that this would only serve to worsen competition ratios for training positions which aren't being increased, and lower salaries.\n The government pressed ahead anyway, with full backing of the media and public.\n In response, the Korean junior doctors all HANDED IN RESIGNATION LETTERS and went on strike.

It’s a new thing for me as I’ve worked three years now and never felt this way. I’m also hypercritical of my knowledge and my ‘output’ on the job so to speak. I feel the need to be seen as a ‘good’ SHO, I really don’t need to be the best by any means but don’t want to be seen as bad. \n For example, I see 200 patients and try and sort them, but if something isn’t done like say the porters aren’t down for X-ray by handover time (although I’ve chased them over and over), then I feel completely shite like it’s my fault. If a referral isn’t done by handover time after chasing then it’s my fault. Put those two things together in one handover then I go home thinking about it and can’t sleep. \n How do you guys manage this?

          "description": "Hi guys, \n Just wanted to ask a little bit more about how LTFT works for shifts like weekends, on-calls and nights? If someone does, say 50% to make it simple, how does that affect the frequency of these shifts? \n Usually on-calls and nights are 4 days in a row each once a month (I'm sure it varies between specialities, but this seems to be the most common), if you're working 50% of the time - does that mean you work 2 days worth of on calls and 2 days of nights per month or is it more than you'd still do your run of 4 days, but its done over 2 months instead? Or is it something differently entirely? Same for weekends, if you have 1 in 3 weekends full time, does that become 1 in 6 if you're LTFT 50%?\n Appreciate the help in advance, thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/DolphinFlips  \n [link]   [comments]",

I find a lot of the time there are minor differences in the shape of twaves between two ECGs ... I invariably run it past a reg who has a quick glance and says yeh probably fine. Some common problems:\n  \nComparing two ECGs and there is new TWI but also the QRS is flipped - is this lead placement/positioning and how can you actually know?\n \nHow far apart do two ECGs need to be to comment on 'dynamic' T wave changes. Admission ECG and 3 days later? Or within 30mins / 60mins of each other. Can a dynamic twave change be flattening as well as inversion?\n \nif a patient is admitted with a baseline ECG showing some TWI, and on repeat ECG their twaves have flipped the other/ 'normal', is this as concerning as flipping the other way\n \n thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Rub_5193  \n [link]   [comments]",

Algorithms can analyze medical images with incredible accuracy, often outperforming human radiologists in certain tasks. \n As someone who hasn’t specialised yet I’m quite worried than sooner than most think an ai will be able to do the job better than a human unless it’s very hands on physical work \n    submitted by    /u/Extreme_Guess6639  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to find a new flat for myself, however, I am not sure if I will be a good candidate for this as I still do not have an employment contract (or a guarantor), even though I have been allocated jobs.\n Is it possible to move apartments this soon before starting FY and still sound credible to the landlord? Is there a letter that my employer can write that would state I will be starting a job in August if I fulfill all the requirements (eg GMC registration, finishing my degree)? My understanding is that you can only receive the actual contract much closer to the start date of your job so how do people manage to get a flat without moving last minute when they are allocated to a new part of the country?

In the last month they have claimed to have been born and grown up in a working class council estate in the north of England, and a couple of weeks later claimed to have been an immigrant from another country moving here for university.\n I’m worried that, when unverified, popular, but questionable accounts (unclear if they are even genuinely a junior doctor) take charge of an important message like that on PAs, their own suspicious activity will damage the message they become so closely tied to.\n Can the BMA do more to advertise that they should be the official spokes people on PA matters in the same way they have been so successfully for strikes?\n This movement is too important to get brought down by questionable characters harnessing it for their own media profile.\n    submitted by    /u/Careful-Target4220  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Bring back paternalistic medicine! \n Patients don't always know what is best for them. Quite frankly a lot of the general public don't have enough knowledge to be able to properly weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of complex treatment options, and we don't have the time to fully explain things in a way that these people will understand. We should make the decision and present the best option to them. I've seen too many patients recently make stupid choices regarding treatment because they don't understand the chances of success and failure. \n Example: Experienced vascular consultant gives patient option A and option B. Option A is to do partial foot amputation. Consultant informs patient that the resulting wound is extremely unlikely to heal due to PVD and that they will almost definitely need to return to surgery to do below knee amputation. Option B is to go straight to below knee amputation which will result in less time in hospital overall. Patient discussed with surgeon and agrees option B. Then family show up and are informed of plan and say \"No, absolutely not. We want a second opinion\". Patient then doesn't want to upset family and decides to choose option A. Patient has surgery, surgery fails, patient returns to theatres several weeks later. Leg is chopped off. Length of stay is longer. NHS has spent all the extra money of the first surgery for no reason. \n Surely it would have been better for the consultant to say \"This is the surgery that we need to do. It is the only option. Anything less will fail and I will not do pointless operations that have an extremely small chance of success*\"?\n *Unless lack of treatment would result in certain death anyway.\n    submitted by    /u/FuneralExitOffspring  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ensure I discuss most patients with the GPs to double check my plans or if I am unsure of what is going on. Despite this, I have found that I have already made 2 mistakes so far. One of them is a prescribing one where I prescribed a longer course of a medication than recommended as I think I misunderstood the GP's advice, I fortunately picked up on it when reading yesterday and will call the patient to let them know before it has any impact on them but this has made me anxious and underconfident. I have very rarely made an impactful mistake in hospital and I unfortunately have this overthinking habit so I struggle with uncertainty and will read up about anything I am unsure about after a work day to learn from it and as a coping mechanism. The downside to this is that I end up identifying issues more than my peers and while this helps patients, it also makes me doubt myself and I worry about my patients and the GPs losing trust in me. I wonder if there is any way to manage these feelings of guilt and under-confidence for doctors who have been in this situation before?

People who don't know this language can't pronounce my name correctly not because it’s hard to pronounce but because they read it literally. It's like how the Slovak name \"Jana\" would be pronounced \"Yana\" in English. Up until now, I never corrected my colleagues and patients to pronounce my name as it's spelled, but that's not how it's really pronounced, and I wonder whether I should start correcting them (as I am starting to feel a bit uncomfortable). People don’t get my name right at first attempt, and when my colleagues are present, they often correct my pronunciation of my name (me: “I’m Jana” … someone “sorry what’s your name again?” … my colleague “Yana”… someone “Ah okay I got it! Nice to meet you, Yana”) \n Would it be too complicated to introduce myself by saying, \"The spelling is Jana, but the pronunciation is Yana\"? Should I change the spelling on my yellow badge to match the pronunciation (“Yana”)? What do other people in similar situations do?

A 24yo woman presented with soft tissue injuries and dislocated shoulder, with a weekly alcohol intake of 34 units. Audit-C score was 7, but CIWA-A was only 1. No symptoms of AWS. A dispute started between the F1 doing the clerking and the bay nurse, about whether she needed immediate benzodiazepine treatment to prevent withdrawal seizures.\n It escalated in a ridiculous way to include the registrar on duty, then the charge nurse, then the ward sister. Their position was that we should give the full protocol, ours was that she'd been assessed at low risk and wasn't dependent. The charge nurse started threatening 'Datix for patient safety' and trying to strongarm the F1 into prescribing.\n The argument ended when the professor in charge of the take wandered towards the noise we were making. He listened for a minute, flicked through the patient notes briefly, glanced at the numbers, then turned to the charge nurse. \"My alcohol intake's higher than that, where's my benzodiazepines?\" Held out his hand and started making 'gimme' gestures. No response.\n Long story short, we stopped being asked to prescribe the meds.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Staterae  \n [link]   [comments]",

I suffered eye trauma in a freak accident, and thanks to your colleagues I've gone from a traumatic cataract, >60 intra-ocular pressure and other assorted grievances to successful surgery, dramatically improved vision and a low, manageable risk of glaucoma. \n I want to thank the brilliant people who helped me, in a way that gives them the recognition they deserve from the brass! No doubt they'll have handled much more serious matters than mine, but this was a scary episode nonetheless. Their skill and compassion made me feel safe - a profoundly valuable thing at a time of vulnerability. \n I gather that an email to PALS helps with the portfolio. What I'd like to know specifically: \n  \nWill a single email about everyone suffice? I don't remember everyone's name (I was seen by a lot of people), but should be able to provide enough identifying info. \n Will the brass read it?\n Will it be seen by the people themselves? On a personal level, I'd like them to know just how much I appreciate them.\n \n A couple of nuggets stand out: \n  \nThe doctor in A&E who calmed me and made me laugh when I was freaking out about my 60+ IOP, and who also had the humility to say that she had to check what to do with the glaucoma consultant. Knowing what you don't know and admitting it is surely the most noble form of intelligence. \n The consultant herself. I suppose we expect consultants to be expert and decisive (she was both), but she was also approachable, attentive and friendly over multiple appointments. \n  \nIt occurs to me that bedside manner is more memorable to patients than hard-earned clinical skill. Perhaps that's just because we understand it better. Anyway, it stays with you, and I salute you all for retaining your humanity in a society that under-values you. \n Sorry for banging on.

          "description": "FY1 rotated onto surgery (3 weeks ago) after 8 months of medicine.\n I've noticed over the last couple of weeks I've been feeling a bit down. Struggling to be present, a little more anxious, and just not as happy.\n Only made the realisation today that a big part of it will be unfulfillment at work. On medicine I was seeing patients independently, having good relationships with seniors, and feeling like a valued member of the medical team. On surgery, the seniors haven't even bothered to learn my name, I am not using my clinical brain whatsoever, and I spend all day doing ward jobs.\n I don't want to feel like this for the next 3.5 months. I don't dread going in and when I'm in I am not having overtly bad days, but I'm just not enjoying life as much. Does anyone have any tips, inside or outside of work, for dealing with this?\n    submitted by    /u/futureformerstudent  \n [link]   [comments]",

The proximity to europe is a big selling point.\n Not sure what stage of my career/UK training this would be possible, I’ve seen the posts around locum positions being harder to come by etc. In Australia we will now have a 2 year internship system (similar to F1/F2), and people will generally work in HMO/SRMO/unaccredited registrar jobs whilst trying to get onto training (can be many years depending on specialty).\n I know people often move internationally for fellowships, however with how long specialty training now takes in Australia, I would likely be mid to late 30s by that point and children makes things harder.\n    submitted by    /u/dansleforet  \n [link]   [comments]",

Been doing F3 and F4 locums via an agency (will keep their name off here) and have spoken to one of my colleagues about the use of umbrella companies. He has informed me that he uses the same company and is getting full take home pay and is sorting out his taxes with his accountants. He has said he has been happy with this arrangement but has recently found out through 2 different agency staff that used to work at this company that they where actually not paying the VAT and the agency staff would take a fixed percentage of this on a weekly basis in forms of a bonus from the \"umbrella company\". \n I was shocked by this and have spoken to a few agencies about this and been advised that there is only two companies that allow this practise and I am shocked and appalled by this. I've calculated it to be that some people can be making £2000 per week from their locum doctors. I have no proof other then these conversations but am I right to feel concerned and what is the best practise? I am not using the same company as my colleague so cant imagine it is being done with my pay.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/No_Sock_9168  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got offered a post in the South London Deanery, and I could use your expert opinions.\n The first thing that I am worried about is the cost of living. Will I be able to afford to live on my own in London with the salary of an ST3? Seeing that now I am almost 30 years old, I think I am ready to start making a step ahead in my life and try to get my own place. I dread the fact that I might be going into my early 30s and not being able to afford to live on my own. \n The second thing that I would like to ask for your advice on is which areas of London would you advise me to seek a house in. My deanery is going to be in South London, but I have heard rumours that it can be quite dangerous. I have never lived in a dangerous city in the past and I would rather avoid areas with high criminal rates. Which areas would you recommend? Do you think it is a good idea to live above the river and commute every day?\n One final thing that I would like to mention is that currently I am not able to afford a car, as I have spent a fortune on my Royal College exams, courses, study material etc. Will I be able to reach the hospitals in my Deanery using public transport or is owning a car a must?\n Many thanks! xoxo\n    submitted by    /u/DeadlyAssassins9  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like the title says, I’m expecting to be involved in an SI. For obvious reasons I will be very vague about the details. \n My biggest mistake was not documenting that I escalated it to the consultant, because consultants are notoriously bad at documenting their actions thereafter so I guess on paper it looks like I was the last contact with the patient. Before I knew the final patient outcome, I told the consultant about my anxiety around the situation and they said “it’s fine, you escalated it to me, it was my responsibility”, but obviously I didn’t write that on paper and they didn’t document anything after that. \n Fully expecting to be contacted about this case and am beyond anxious about how it will play out. \n I’m a foundation year. Will involvement in something like this affect my future career? \n As soon as I felt out of my depth with the symptoms, that’s when I handed it over to the consultant. Technically the symptom was escalated to me, but I didn’t know what to do so I escalated further. We all know the first month of rotation is very much finding your feet, I had no idea what to do in this specific situation, hence the further escalation as I wasn’t getting anywhere. If something goes wrong, do consultants often field the responsibility and inquests themselves or do they often bounce the blame back at the more junior doctor? \n I’m absolutely terrified and this physical and overwhelming anxiety is enough to make me seriously question a future in this career. I don’t ever want to be involved in this stuff but it seems like perfect storms happen and I fucking hate this \n    submitted by    /u/throwawayclosureex  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm an img due to CCT in less than a year, and it just keeps looking like I should either leave the UK and/or GP as a speciality.\n First off, GP is really grueling. Infact more gruelling than my previous job in ED. Most people seem to only be able to tolerate 6-7 sessions/wk. As a salaried that can be as low as 66-77k a year. As a clinical fellow in ED I was making 63k after banding. Like...what is the point in being a salaried GP? \n Like I can genuinely make more than this, if I currently go back to work as a clinical fellow job in Wales,Scotland or NI. It would probably be easier too.\n Last week, my supervisor the other week said to me \"it's true the job market is bad. It's true that you are competing with ARRs roles\". So I have to work super hard for 66-77k. Pathetic. Why not just retrain in literally any speciality in Wales?\n I don't understand. I really like this country and want to work here. But why would anyone continue to work this hard in GP? Like It's feel literally crazy for me to stay in this country. \n Please tell me I'm missing something.

Also find it bizarre most claim not to be trained in taking bloods from children and expect an F1 or any other doctor who doesn’t come across children nearly as much as them to do the bloods instead. Paediatric trainee doctors constantly have to do their own urine dipsticks and observations - can their HCA/nurses not do this? Adult nurses are also busy but they don’t go around saying “im busy I’ll try if I can get round to it” when you ask them to do the most basic thing. Also paediatric nurses when they speak to speciality teams honestly just come across as rude and entitled and quick to behave passive aggressively or straight up rude. I find the temperament of (most) adult nurses to be a lot more mature, level headed and less likely to behave like a bratty teenage girl. \n Could someone shed light on this? \n    submitted by    /u/Notsozestylemon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I then got into core surgical training on the second attempt - this was a huge feat for me and I worked damn hard to get in. I thought I’d made it. I thought I was finally going to be a surgeon. My CST years were some of the most gruelling of my life - i sacrificed so much to progress and prepare a portfolio for St3 applications. The MRCS exams took a huge mental toll on me. I sat Part A 3 times and passed Part B the first time. Regarding MRCS, I wasn’t alone. I know a lot of my colleagues who also had multiple attempts. Since finishing core surgical training, I have applied to ST3 Trauma and Orthopaedic surgery 3 times. I have been unsuccessful each time. I thought this year was different. I had prepared very well only to be thrown under the bus in the interview. The clinical scenarios were much harder than previous years and I feel like the whole interview process was just poorly delivered. I am also disappointing my family and friends by not getting a training number so the mental toll is a lot. I am planning to give it 1 more shot next year.

But everyone around me (literally every other IMT3 I work with) is hellbent on entering training ASAP as everyone says there won't be any training numbers left soon. Everyone else is off to take ST4 numbers in August. I've taken a more chilled approach this year as it doesn't seem to be quite the mega competition of core training (yet....) and my mental health is sort of in the toilet.\n I'd love 1-2 years out to decompress, see the world, see family, be a normal non doctor human. I'm pre kids so I could have a lot of freedom and nice times. Or I could aim for ST4 next round starting training in Feb 2025 (if I'm lucky, there should be numbers in areas of country I'd like to live in).....\n Is being a consultant lots better? Should I be pushing towards consultancy soon and ending the misery of med reg night shifts and rotating? Or will I be a 35 year old consultant with a couple of kids regretting prioritising my career over a couple of fufilling years out of training?\n I'm female and expect to take a few mat leaves and then LTFT so I suspect I won't get there very fast regardless, it's whether or not I add 1-2 years extra on by taking some time to chill now vs cracking on with HST for a couple years at 100%. We see young people die at work which I think skews my view that life is short and work doesn't matter all that much.\n I'd love to hear from anyone who entered ST4 after a couple of years out, do you regret it now when you see people who were at your stage and are now consultants whilst you're still working nights? Or do you feel lucky that you had amazing experiences that you just can't have in your 40s/50s when tied down by kids and a mortgage?\n P.S.

          "description": "I'll start off with fonts and styles. This may be of importance to those doctors whose work is text-intensive and where quality of presentation matters e.g. senior doctors in psychiatry and expert witness doctors. \n In psychiatry the work is text intensive for producing reports of various kinds: Tribunal reports, Managers' reports, CPA, CTR, Court of Protection and so on. Presentancy is 'everything' (chuhknowwhuhahmean). Most 'medics' - or is that doctors - don't give a monkeys about fonts or Styles. Some don't know what's that Style ribbon at the top of MS Word is for, nor do their typists (secretaries or admins). I'm not doing a tutorial on that here. \n What is of relevance is that for the doctors who need to format there work for 'presentancy' and readability (like me) are being told that Trusts require all correspondence to be in Arial 12pt, by policy. No such policy has been found over the last 10 years of me searching for it across 10 Trusts. I dare say it does not exist.\n But wait - I started off with one issue to illustrate something else that happens in your beloved NHS What's that?\n Loads of people make up policies as they go along. The commonest is 'good practice'. Nobody quoting anything of 'good practice' has been able to provide me with a reference to the 'good practice'. \n The other one was \"No patient gets Sectioned unless they have a CTR (care and treatment review).\" No such policy exists in writing anywhere and if it exists it is legally wrong. \n And another, \"Intensive support must be consulted before a LD patient is sectioned\". Doesn't exist. Can't find that anywhere (though it may well exist in a neck of the woods somewhere that I've not been). \n I'd like to hear from those who have witnessed the same sort of making up of policies. \n    submitted by    /u/Capitan_Walker  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Quick question that has me a bit baffled…\n I was in an elective c-section, after birth baby had poor tone and no initial respiratory effort. Anyways after resuscitation by the midwife, the buzzer was pulled as baby’s sats were still low despite inflation breaths, NG aspiration of stomach and subsequent face mask O2.\n In response to the buzzer and “paeds” being called, an ACP from paeds attended. She was great, and I learnt stuff from her when I was asking questions about management, and it seemed that everything right was done for baby.\n But an ACP? To essentially a crash call? For adults senior doctors attend. So what is going on here? The ACP seemed quite well versed in everything, but this doesn’t sit right with me. \n There was a point where the ACP said “if things don’t improve by x time, I’m calling my reg”, but why wasn’t a paediatrician there initially? NICU is on the same floor!!! \n I know that even paeds isn’t safe from scope creep and noctors, but can’t we get real doctors to attend to a neonatal emergency.\n Maybe this was because it hadn’t quite gotten to cardiac arrest?

Last week we had a student join us during the morning MDT meeting and introduced herself as a medical student. We did a few cases together during the week and she seemed uninterested in anything I had to teach but was very keen to jump in and take over the patient interviews. I didn't mind her confidence but she took irrelevant histories and didn't seem to understand a lot of basics. She always tried to go out of her way to agree with the consultant and it felt like she was trying to \"one up\" me. It really didn't seem like normal behaviour for a medical student so figured she was just a very driven student who had yet to start her downward journey on the dunning-kruger graph.\n I found out from one of the nurses that she was a nursing student, and was told many of them introduce themselves as medical students, which we agreed was disingenuous. She later confirmed that she would be finishing nursing school soon when asked in front of our MDT.\n I'm not originally from the UK, but is it normal for nursing students to identify themselves as medical students?

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n So, I work on an elderly care discharge ward, where people are supposed to be MOFD. But spending months waiting for social issues to sort out, they keep getting new medical issues.\n Plus, there are chronic medical issues that families want taken care of, while they are in the hospital, as an opportunistic bonus.\n Now, its basically just me and a PA (nice but relatively new). Before, it was me and another SHO and we used to divide patients evenly.\n We're being told to prioritize TTOs rather than clinical reviews because pharmacy can't process orders (dosette boxes) in time if we do them after noon\n The issue at hand is that i usually need time to look at a patient my own way, and write in my own style. I'm a bit conscious of making sure that I'm not missing any key details when reviewing a patient, or that any TTO I write is well written.\n Also, the ward manager is insisting that instead of breaking up patients, we divide tasks instead. Things like \"Oh, the PA can write the discharge summary and you can prescribe.....\"\n The PA is a nice lady and she can take bloods decent enough...(somewhat)\n The problem is, I can't review patients late (all the investigation results and imaging gets delayed), and I seriously hate prescribing meds (Especially CDs) when the written portion is a missing key details (like why a drug was discontinued or whether a resus status was changed)\n I take pride in my work, and want to do it in its entirety.\n Does anyone how to handle this kinda workload?\n It's gotten so bad that normally, an MOFD patient is supposed to be reviewed every week just to see if they're ok, and no one's reviewing them for 2-3 weeks.\n    submitted by    /u/hadriancanuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

From 1 October 2022 Officer pension contribution tiers in England and Wales are linked to actual pensionable pay and not the notional full time equivalent rate.\"\n NHSBA seems to suggest differently \"Overtime, in relation to the NHS Pension Scheme, is hours worked in excess of the whole time standard working week. Therefore a part timer’s pensionable pay must include any additional hours worked up to the whole time working week, and hours worked over the whole time working week are not pensionable. For example, if the standard working week is 37.5 hours, a part timer normally working 20 hours a week may pay pension contributions on up to 17.5 additional hours per week.\"\n But then also this from NHSBA? \"The payroll solution must use the previous scheme years actual pensionable earnings to set the member contribution rate (instead of using whole-time equivalent earnings).

          "description": "Looking for advice on getting an SAS / specialty doctor post in sexual health / GUM.\n I'm a GP by background (CCTed a few years ago), and have worked in a non clinical public health related job for the past year. I've got an interest in sexual health with a couple of previous GUM jobs during training and have done the DFSRH. A little out of date with it all now, but really enjoyed previous work in this area. \n I'd really appreciate advice from anyone who works as a specialty (non-training grade) doctor in sexual health. Particularly interested in how you ended up in this role, what level of experience is needed, and how I can improve my chances of getting a post. \n If anyone is willing to have a chat or offer some advice on this would be much appreciated.

One of the patients was grateful and very emotional and brought us biscuits as a gesture. When the patient left the clinic, the assistant immediately picked the 3£ gift and went: “Are we even allowed to accept that? I’ll put it in the staff room and you can help yourselves if you want you”\n I mean FFS !!!! Our assistants are so brainwashed from the ridiculously demeaning position of NHS doctors that they would not even have the courtesy to ask permission from the consultant, who the gift is presumably for and who is also in charge of their own clinic, before taking the gift away.\n I did a good job for my patient, my patient expressed their gratefulness by gifting a 3£ biscuit, I felt rewarded that they are grateful- but no, the NHS culture would make sure to remind us that we do not even deserve this gesture.\n I am so fed up with the recurrent manifestations of this upside down hierarchy at the NHS where everyone think, act and actually are the bosses except doctors. I think this culture towards doctors at the NHS is so bad that I doubt reversing it would happen in my lifetime and I would rather run away than spending my career devalued.\n Rant over\n Edit: typos\n    submitted by    /u/DecentTrouble94  \n [link]   [comments]",

The simulator is pretty simple: a mannequin, a monitor, some dummy drugs to be drawn up or checked, some blood gas print outs and people pretending to be nurses, registrars etc. The trainees are final year medical students, FY1s and FY2s. The simulated scenarios are vanilla adult medical and surgical emergencies in which the trainee is called to the ward for a patient that's \"gone off\".\n The scenarios themselves seem pretty realistic and I try to make the debriefings as educational as possible using the After Action Review model, but it seems the trainees get no particular preparation on emergencies before the simulation day and there's no follow up afterwards on lessons identified. It's just one or two simulator days a year in isolation. I've discussed this with the faculty who run the simulator but their view is that preparation and follow up are Someone Else's Problem.\n Has anyone had better experience of sim training than this?\n    submitted by    /u/larus_crassirostris  \n [link]   [comments]",

They stated that since the patient has a junctional tachycardia the treatment of choice is either IV amiodarone or IV flecainide. \n I had a read about junctional tachycardia vs SVT. \n So junctional tachycardia is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR >100. SVT is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR >150. \n I've been trying to find a good paper to explain the management of junctional tachycardias because it sounds a bit different compared with SVT but I can't find anything. One paediatric paper said that we can give amiodarone, another said phenytoin. And wikipedia has actually been the most helpful and said that we don't normally do DC cardioversion in junctional tachycardia. \n Is anyone able to shed some light on the management of junctional tachycardia and how it differs to SVT?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/CoconutFrequent8576  \n [link]   [comments]",

You don’t have enough experience to secure a training number, and there are no locum opportunities. So what do you do? You’re essentially unemployed from a medical point of view. No fellowships, no trust grade jobs. All over subscribed. \n I give it 2-3 years before doctors unemployed in hundreds if not thousands. What can be done? I’m not sure if I’m being honest. I hope the BMA has plans, because honestly this is a much bigger issue than FPR.

Now that the government doesn't want GP to issue fit note, why can't this go to PAs instead?

I hope you can shine some light on my dilemma. \n I have recently been accepted for an MBA in a top business school with a 50% scholarship - which is still a big investment. For some context, I am an IMG doctor and I co-founded a startup in London after my foundation training which went well but never took off. Last year I decided that it was time to do something different and I applied for the MBA and took a Clinical Fellow post. During my Clinical fellow post (part-time) I rediscovered my passion for medicine and how nice it is to directly help people and I managed to get an IMT spot in the reserve list in an ok location. The MBA would give me a higher salary on a corporate job but it would take me away from medicine and I am not sure I am ready for it! I am thinking about declining or at least trying to defer the MBA offer to next year and do 1 year of IMT to see how I feel. Everyone that I spoke with told me that I would regret my choice and that I am romanticising medicine as I haven't been full-time in a long time. \n I want to hear your opinion on that, especially from doctors and consultants who like what they do. Is it that bad? What about when you become a consultant? Am I making the wrong decision?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Apart_Doctor_5804  \n [link]   [comments]",

He was previously informed that I would be seeing him at a certain time. I was then told that he was busy masturbating. I asked someone to ask him to clean up as I'll be there in a few minutes, me thinking he'd be done by then. Minutes pass. I get to outside his room (door closed). Staff tell me \"He's still at it.\" So I waited about 10 minutes outside of his room. Someone said I should knock and enter. I did not. I spoke with staff outside of his room for the 10 minutes. Then I had to depart for a meeting as I was now running late. He then opened the door to his room as I was about to depart and seemed to want to talk. I couldn't as I was going to be late for the important meeting. I thought there was a funny side but off course said nothing of the sort. I breached no standard of practice as far as I am aware. \n I am unable to reveal other details - and don't ask why.

At the moment, I'm anticipating to CCT in probably 7-8 years after all of ST and ?fellowship assuming I stay 100% and pass all my exams/expected competencies in a reasonable time frame. \n I know people have talked about going to Australia or the Middle East, but frankly I'm not that keen on the latter, and if everyone's thinking of going to Australia or Canada after CCT-ing - what is the landscape even going to look like for me when I flee 8 years down the line? 😅 I do predict there will be healthcare shortages, but I would think locally, they'd also be looking to expand medical school/training places to accommodate in the next decade too. Is the prospect of CCT and flee as an ST1 even realistic?\n Also, I know ophthalmology is one of the more lucrative specialties, so surely there must be some barriers in place to emigrating vs a specialty that has a more supportive role (e.g. rads, anaes).\n    submitted by    /u/ophthalmologyornot  \n [link]   [comments]",

However they are refusing to give a zero day on the week with a bank holiday. They also state because I moved the working weekend I’m not owed a zero day (I moved the weekend before they agreed to give me any zero days at all, so I’d argue if I cancel my swap I need my zero day, then reinstate the swap). Note, the working pattern given above is the original rotation (as if the weekend had not been swapped). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.\n Also, do the swaps also have to comply with rotation rules?

I was looking at ways to bolster my income and fell onto ear syringing. I have good experience in performing it, albeit not having attended any formal courses, and feel it's relatively low risk as I intent to take a good history and ensure I'm not suctioning at a steatoma with my otoscope. A local dental practice I'm on good terms with (not my own dentist) have offered a chair a day a week to run a mini clinic. \n Has anyone got experience in this market? I've been having difficulty finding any real info on indemnity around this. Most of the indemnity products I've found are aimed at companies/clinics with multiple practitioners. Further, does anyone know the situation with making the clinic compliant? I've read about needing CQC approval down south, but again, can't find any info on Scotland. \n Any input is welcome! \n    submitted by    /u/Few_Ad19  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m currently a CT1 in surgery and I’m four years into medicine. I’ve done nights regularly for three of the four years. I’m still disablingly scared of them, even if I’m actually OK on the actual stretch. My current job has quite a few nights but workload is generally okay, so my anxiety is not bad but it’s certainly problematic. I find myself trawling the ED track board for hours before my shift predicting who I might have to see or not. Advice is never too far away but I am so scared of appearing shit that I prepare and over prepare. There really is no point trying to predict referrals as I know what to do with most of them anyway, but it’s a compulsion I can’t stop. \n My next rotation will be in a speciality I have little knowledge on, but I will be covering wards AND referrals overnight. I’m scared I’m going to perpetually be a wreck. I sometimes get fleeting thoughts of calling in sick so I don’t have to deal with it - I never, ever do, but it’s so tempting sometimes that I’m ashamed to say that sometimes the thought lingers a bit too long in my head. \n It doesn’t help that my sleep is almost universally shit on them, and my eating isn’t much better. \n Grateful for any help/tips/reassurance that this can pass, and I can trust myself a bit more. \n    submitted by    /u/Material_Raspberry30  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Yet another incoming FY1 here. Basically I have a 2 year gap between graduating and starting F1 in which I did nothing medicine-related. I feel like I've forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn't that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don't remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.\n Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO's (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I've been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I've also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I've contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? \n Just for a little more info: I’m starting on gen surg. Also I'm hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I'm honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I'm working a 9-5 office job which I'm looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. \n Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I'm ready to put my best foot forward and I’m honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound.

In the BMA MAP scope, it says teaching is not to happen unless it falls within the safe parameters of working for MAPS. Does this mean things both within the green and orange boxes?\n For example, in psych, the green for MAPS is physical healthcare related only. So does this mean PA can teach related to performing a physical exam, but shouldn’t be teaching things like MSE/History taking? \n Likewise, O&G, orange box is refit or replace vaginal pessaries.

The case that you are reflecting on is [insert scenario] and the learning points that you want to take away are [insert learning points]. The reflective piece should be between 500-1000 words and should be based on the Gibbs reflective cycle. Keep a professional tone but inject some evidence of empathy throughout the text” \n I’ve been getting middling results with this and was wondering if anyone has any pointers on how to improve the prompt? \n Edit: totally on board with the responses about 500-1000 words being way too long.

When I tried to get a fob to access the car park, I was told that because I'm only there for 4 months, I'm not eligible for a fob. When I asked the admin team where I was supposed to park, they told me to park on the roads nearby. The placement is in quite a deprived area, and I didn't feel comfortable parking on the roads a few minutes walk away. So I parked in the patients' car park a few times, and was issued a £100 fine.\n I ended up telling the consultant that I'm under about the whole situation, and he was very indignant about it. Sent an email to the admin team straightaway and I got a car park fob the next day. In hindsight, should have told the consultant about it a lot sooner.\n Just really nice to have your consultant stick up for you!\n https://preview.redd.it/i9upklyx70wc1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ead216b9becfc7dd05023eaa12877de00384a8be\n    submitted by    /u/Firstbornsyndrome  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m in my 40s and have recently become aware that the reason I’m weird in all the specific ways that I am is almost certainly to do with having ADHD or something very similar. \n It started when I listened to a podcast with Dr Russell Barkley and was like, “That’s me!” to just about everything he said. Then I did some online ADHD tests and answering the questions it pretty much felt the same as if there had just been a photo of me and the question, “Is this you?” Needless to say they all said I probably had it. \n Until finding this out I’ve always felt weird and different and misunderstood and have had a lot of issues with depression, self-loathing and suicidal ideation. It always felt like people were telling me, “just be a different person!” And I wasn’t able to convince them that I couldn’t. To help make life a bit more bearable I smoke weed, and have done almost daily now for 25 years (also I drink too much and am on Fluoxetine for the depression, but don’t feel addicted to these as I am with weed). \n I went to the doctor and asked if I could get assessed and they said that I couldn’t because I drink and smoke weed. I feel like I’m in a Catch-22 because I need the weed to deal with the adhd, and if I was being properly treated for that then maybe I’d be able to give up the weed, but I’m not allowed to get assessed for that until I’ve given up the weed which I can’t do until… and on and on. \n They’ve referred me to a drugs and alcohol service and I will go along and try, but I honestly have zero belief I can do it. I really can’t picture a life where I don’t have my weed; the very idea of it gives me a feeling of terrifying emptiness. \n Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What can I do?\n PS I can’t afford to get privately assessed. \n    submitted by    /u/Silver_Drop6600  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was hoping to be assigned to a surgeon who i read about online and has amazing reviews and statistics. The one i saw instead was very knowledgeable, however i can’t find anything about him online in relation to this type of surgery. Firstly, is there a place i could go / call to get his statistics or find ‘reviews’? I think maybe i’m able to find them for the other guy as he also does private work, so places post reviews for that. Online it says it used to be MyNHS but they’ve closed that website. \n Secondly, could i request to be with the surgeon i initially found? everyone i’ve spoken to about this surgery has said the most important thing is to find a good surgeon that you trust completely. I know under patients choice you can choose a specific hospital, but can i request a specific surgeon? I haven’t been booked into a slot yet so thinking maybe I still have time to ask?

          "description": "(23F in England) 6 months ago I went to the GP for PCOS symptoms (as I hadn’t had a period in 6 months and PCOS runs in my family), and the GP did a pelvic exam on me. He brought in a chaperone (one of the female receptionists) and asked me to strip my bottom half and I was covered with a paper towel, and inserted a speculum - I’ve never had a smear test or anything done so I wasn’t expecting it. He then proceeded to basically reach inside me (elbow deep) and said ‘I’m going to feel your ovaries now, this will probably hurt’ and it felt like he was squeezing them, it was extremely painful and it felt very invasive and not what I expected at all from the appointment. He then referred me for an ultrasound I got a few weeks later, where they diagnosed me with PCOS on the spot.\n It was a horrible experience but today, my sister went to the GP also with PCOS symptoms. Her doctor said they would refer her straight for an ultrasound and she asked if they were going to do a pelvic exam first, to which the doctor looked extremely confused and said that’s not the procedure here, and when she said my sister had a pelvic exam before being referred for an ultrasound the doctor looked at her horrified, and said that shouldn’t have happened and that’s not how PCOS is diagnosed. \n I don’t know if it’s relevant but before the exam my doctor did make some slightly odd comments to me, asking if I had eye contacts in because my eyes are really blue.\n My question is, was this pelvic exam the standard procedure of diagnosing PCOS, especially if I had symptoms and a family history, and he was going to refer me for a diagnostic ultrasound anyway? I hadn’t thought too much about it but after my sisters’ GP appointment today it’s concerned me quite a bit. Is there anyone I can talk to at my practice about it, or does it need to be escalated? I can’t remember the name of the doctor I saw, I’m not sure if he was a locum or not.\n Thanks in advance for any advice.\n    submitted by    /u/crc138  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hoping this NHS group can answer or point me in the right direction! \n I own and operate an NHS partner company, we supply temporary staff across England, Wales and Scotland, we are a Tier 1 supplier and have been a partner since 2015 on all National Clinical Frameworks. \n The mission and purpose of the company is to eradicate profiteering agencies supplying staff to the NHS either at exterminate rates on the suppliers chain or off-framework which means out of contract. \n That being said, to achieve the mission I needed to invest several million pounds in developing technology to achieve this (happy to explain to anyone curious about business in general!) \n So I sought investment from the private market, Family Offices/VC's etc. BUT something didn't and still doesn't feel right, building a company in a public sector is good if it economically impacts the market for the better but that also results in profits and ultimately a value company, I don't feel totally comfortable with operating this model and the workforce of the NHS not co-owning part of this business.\n SO... my question, would anyone know where I can open a conversation to explore how this could be possible and seeing who would be interested in co-owning the company with me?

Very messed up but it would not be a huge surprise, he is a compulsive liar and has comfortably lied about big issues many many times. \n She has been asking for information as he’s texted her saying he does not have long to live (something brain tumor related always pops up when they have a disagreement or when she is busy so can’t see him ect…) \n She has been pushing but he won’t tell her the doctors names, mixed up the names of medication he’s supposedly on, basically won’t talk about it unless he feels her pulling away (he can be quite controlling & dependant) and his hospital is down the road but he didn’t want her taking him to an appointment…anyway there is good reason to believe this is false, she also lost her best friend to a brain tumor not long ago which he knows about. \n She was pushing to know what the doctors said so he showed her this letter the next day and panicked a bit when she took a picture. To me this looks like a very unprofessional letter , a couple spelling mistakes and contradictions. Also address & phone number in strange format. I have researched what I can but I am no doctor! And some things look like they don’t add up. Also starting with ‘we are pleased to inform you’ then later stating he has a terminal illness??

          "description": "I was informed by my GP on 10th May that my faecal immunochemical test (FiT) returned a result of 16 ug/g. The referral I received is titled \"Suspected Cancer Referral Form,\" although it is noted as “2ww referral letter done” in my medical records. As a 29-year-old male with ongoing anaemia, I have undergone three colonoscopies at two-year intervals, along with several gastroscopies and capsule endoscopies. Thanks to my private healthcare, these tests have always been swiftly arranged and done by my consultant.\n My GP has advised that I will be contacted tomorrow to schedule a colonoscopy within the same week. Since this will be my first colonoscopy conducted under the NHS, I have a couple of queries:\n  \nWill the procedure be performed by a consultant or specialist doctor, such as a gastroenterologist, rather than by a different type of practitioner like a specialist nurse?\n \nTypically, in private healthcare, I would discuss the results with my consultant immediately after the procedure and receive a detailed report to take away in a folder. Can I expect a similar process under the NHS, or will I need to wait for a follow-up from my GP? Additionally, is it possible to request that a copy of the endoscopy report be sent directly to me as well as to my GP? Can the consultant performing the procedure also include my private gastroenterologist in the correspondence from the outset? I’ll be sure to see them whatever the outcome in a few months as a matter of routine.\n \n Thanks to anyone who can help with any of this. \n    submitted by    /u/Interesting_Craft_94  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Apparently there have been multiple cases recently of Propranolol prescriptions for anxiety being stopped or taken off repeat by GPs.\n I think it's to do with lethality in overdose, but anyone know why this is happening now?\n There was a Health Services Safety Investigations Body report on the issue, but that was published in 2020.\n As far as I know, Propranolol isn't recommended for anxiety in the NICE guidelines, but it is listed in the BNF and mentioned on the NHS website. \n I'm guessing that it's never been directly licensed for anxiety, but is instead dosed to help with physical symptoms of anxiety, and it's those physical symptoms which the licensing connects to. I can't see that off label use would be a big deal here anyway.\n As for people killing themselves with it, that obviously needs awareness and might be a reason to stop prescriptions to under 18s; or consider whether it's the best option for someone with a history of self poisoning say.\n However, in general, with adults, to stop patient A having a useful medication to try to protect patient B from themselves, is very ethically questionable imo. I don't see why you harm one patient to help another. Even assuming a policy would save lives, it's not a strictly medical question whether you should implement it in this kind of situation.\n My own experience with a GP refusing me a different medication on grounds of \"lethality in overdose\", is firstly they weren't open about their reasoning until they were forced to be, so they were basically dishonestly recommending an alternative medication. Then because they were factually wrong, I tried to explain that the alternative they were offering me was actually the more dangerous medication, but they wouldn't listen. They openly told me that it was about \"covering their behind\". (Not an exact quote but that was their meaning.)\n    submitted by    /u/Alex_VACFWK  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am currently employed in a hospital here. But right now I have no idea if NHS accepts or even considers candidates like me who has a history of being dismissed.

          "description": "I work in Primary Care as a social link worker, and lately I just keep getting referral after referral from GPs of very mentally ill patients who are actively suicidal, and when I check their Emis record there is no referral to mental health services whatsoever. Is this common for GPs to just not refer a patient who is actively suicidal or displays very bizarre behaviour during a consultation? I cover 9 practices (by myself) and this occurs across all 9 practices. It's taking away from me being able to actually do my role which is community engagement and maybe some light coaching work to motivate people. I'm also non-urgent and currently am swamped with the amount of people on my wait list. I'm worried someone is actually going to die waiting for me to get to them and feel like the GPs can't be bothered to do the referral/legwork so send them to me instead.\n We had a meeting a while back (monthly staff training) where reps from local MH trusts and charities came to talk to us about how to refer and some of the GPs were sniggering into their phones and talking amongst themselves whilst these people were speaking. Is this just my PCN or is this the prevalent attitude of Primary Care doctors?\n It's frightening and it's stressing me out so much. \n    submitted by    /u/AloneInTheTown-  \n [link]   [comments]",

He is currently in hospital with a severe infection, while also waiting for an operation.\n I'm looking for advice on how to get 'involved' with his treatment. My Dad (and Mum) are lovely people but they don't know how to navigate the NHS and struggle to understand basic medical terminology and advice. They are great parents, this just isn't the kind of thing they've dealt with before. This has left me and my brother struggling to know what's going on and we aren't confident our parents are asking the right questions/ understanding and following advice. For example, my mum wasn't sure if my dad had sepsis or meningitis after speaking to the doctor.\n Is there a process/ system in place that will allow me to be more involved? I'm hoping my dad can nominate me and I can be present in important appointments to understand more and translate for my parents. I've been lucky and haven't had any health issues serious enough to know how the NHS works, but I'm confident I can help my parents (and I think they would agree).\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_London  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then I've accessed therapy and counselling, I've been on medication...no luck (don't worry, I'm not seeking advice). A year ago I requested a psychiatry referral as both myself and my GP suspected PTSD and figured I could use tailored treatment and a diagnosis would help me advocate for myself. This resulted in a phone call with the Access team that lasted all of 10 minutes, I wasn't assessed by anyone but I was discharged to Healthy Minds.\n Healthy Minds didnt help and neither did SARC. A year on and I've deteriorated massively, I'm completely socially withdrawn, I've lost 2 stone (I was 9 stone) and my personality has taken a 180 into volatility central. My ex is undergoing sentencing so my symptoms are exacerbated badly by the resurfacing of everything. In light of things getting worse I put in another referral for assessment.\n Had another phone call today and within 2 minutes they're recommending I be discharged to Healthy Minds based on the consultant's reading of my file (I was speaking with his secretary I think?). I wound up losing my rag and after about 20 minutes the lady began assessing me and conceded that my symptoms are in line with C-PTSD and should be reviewed.\n My question is, is this common in the mental health services in the NHS? Psychiatrists not assessing people, just skimming over their files when the referral comes through and deciding \"ah, it's probably fine\"? I hear people lament others not calling out for help so often, but if most people are anything like me they're begging for help and being let down by bureaucracy.\n    submitted by    /u/YarnleyFelt  \n [link]   [comments]",

A few hours later they were admitted to AMU.\n Still on the AMU this morning they spoke to their renal consultant, based at that hospital, by phone and found that nobody had consulted renal at all at any point. The renal consultant has now paged a registrar to get involved.\n Talking about this in our CKD patients support group chat it seems some variant of this story, a lack or delay of referral is a fairly common experience. One person even had to involve his local MP to get his care and subsequent transplant process moving again.\n Is this just bad luck? Or is there a systemic issue that prevents these types of referrals from happening promptly?

The only question she asked was “how are you feeling?” as I prefer seeing private professionals, I replied “fine”.\n I checked my records and I see that she has coded questions and answers which she never asked and completely made up the answers.\n I called my NHS GP practice to let them know that my medical records had been updated with gibberish and that I wanted a correction.\n They got the same PA to call me and she said she “made a mistake” and that she “used her best clinical judgment” to fill in answers based on my saying I was “fine”. She answered questions about my levels of anxiety with completely made up answers even though I am seeing a private therapist for these anxiety problems.\n I said to her on the phone I was not happy with her cavalier attitude regarding my medical records and that this couldn’t be a “mistake” since she knowingly filled my record with bs data. That’s when she said I should stop being condescending towards her…\n I must say I am pretty shocked following this encounter, she apologised for making a “mistake” and that she “understood my frustration” she actually asked me the questions she had taken upon herself to answer in my stead and surprise surprise, her “clinical judgment” was a mile off my actual answers.\n Is this normal/ok? I always thought medical records were critical and confidential. Are PAs even allowed to access them? Are they really allowed to feed the system bs data they have made up with no patient input?\n This is in England.

I spoke to management and this was smoothed over.\n My 6 month probation I failed and the same things were highlighted although I shared I felt this was unfair due to making improvements. \n I had lots of positive feedback however the same issues were still present (apparently) although I was never advised of this and was never told about this.\n I was told this would be extended 3 months and my matron said that it’s fine and she wants to support me the best she can and will do everything to help me alongside start sending emails with any concerns or difficulties so there is a paper trail they can show HR to show I’m doing well. They also said it was going to be extended 6 weeks however it’s now going to be 3 months as it protects the trust from being accused of unfair dismissal.\n My concerns are has this been extended as they wish to fire me? MH is so subjective and it really depends on who is manager that day!

For the past 4-5 months I’ve had several gp appointments/A&E visits for ongoing chest pain which is getting worse and spreading to other areas (my neck/back/legs). I’ve had the general tests done & an ECG which all came back fine. I’ve been told it is anxiety & there is nothing they can do and I should get counselling. I have been huffed and puffed at and belittled for months by doctors, meanwhile the pain has carried on increasing so much to the point that I can barely get out of bed. I don’t have much quality of life and I spend everyday in tears trying to live with the pain.\n I feel incredibly stuck & frustrated because the NHS will not help me. They keep suggesting I need counselling, but don’t put anything in place for me to gain access to it? I was prescribed diazepam after an A&E visit and it made no difference. Paracetamol and other pain killers have not helped in the slightest either. I had another GP appointment today and my doctor literally sighed at me and told me there is nothing they can do and I should look into psychiatric help, then sent me off home with nothing put in place. Shouldn’t they be the ones arranging that help? I’m at my wits end.\n I’m exhausted from the constant pain & feel helpless because I’m repeatedly being brushed off. I’m willing to believe it’s anxiety as it’s all I hear, but no one’s telling me how to fix it. I don’t feel anxious at all which is what is utterly confusing me, I’m just in a lot of physical pain and it’s unbearable. What can I do in this situation? If the NHS is ignoring me & not putting anything in place to help ease the pain, where do I go from there? I haven’t attended university at all the past month or so due to the increase in pain. I feel totally out of options. \n I just feel like I should be receiving more help than I’ve been given. The pain gets worse literally everyday, at this point I feel like I’m living in a nightmare.

I understand the NHS is under a great deal of pressure and they need the beds but it feels they are just repeatedly treating the symptoms without treating the cause.

Teacher for 5 years, then moved to IT project management following a software MSc and stayed for almost 7 years. Recently I’ve been struggling in my PM job with the pressure/hours/internal mismanagement and decided to follow my 18yo self’s dream of working in healthcare and becoming a nurse so I took a job as a HCA in a local trust with a view to studying and working at the same time to become an RN.\n Nearly a month in and I’m miserable. There’s an underlying culture of bullying from management to lower bands and it’s bitchy and there are obvious cliques. The drs and senior nurses are really patronising and often make jokes that I’m the most overqualified HCA they’ve ever had. The pay is horrific (which I knew) and my elderly parents are leaning on me increasingly for financial support. My partner and I are thinking of starting a family soon and as I’m not getting any younger I think it might be wise to return to corporate (not to the same company) for more stability, better wage and more flexibility once we have kids.\n Should I stick it out with healthcare or go back to corporate? My issue was more with the company I worked for as a PM as opposed to the work. I figure that time isn’t on my side in terms of having a family and that’s more important to me than anything right now.

If so, could anyone direct me to the SIGN guidelines for the treatment of EUPD (I’m struggling to find them). 3. If not, are they generally the same as the NICE guidelines? 4. Any general advice would be appreciated. \n Context: I was “unofficially” diagnosed with EUPD a really long time ago and no one ever told me. I’m contesting it with the CMHT and not being listened to. \n From reading the NICE guidelines, generally my take away was that the patient should be fully informed and involved in their treatment. This didn’t happen with me. When I’ve asked about diagnosis before I’ve only been told “we don’t want to diagnose you, just treat symptoms”. No psychology referrals were ever explained to me. I went to them so I wouldn’t be discharged from services but they were geared towards trauma and consistent emotional dysregulation and it confused me honestly. \n This year however, I’ve been talking very directly about diagnosis and still only receiving deflection. I was treated very obviously for it at a crisis centre but they wouldn’t be honest. I brought it up directly several times saying I don’t agree that I have the condition. I had to make a subject access request to confirm. (I now see the lack of good practice that led to the assumption and it’s pretty shocking). \n The Mental Welfare Commission told me that if I asked about diagnosis I should have been told one of two things: 1. You’re being treated for EUPD 2. We don’t want to disclose your diagnosis to you because it may worsen your condition. They also told me I should have been told one of these anyway unprompted. \n It doesn’t appear that I’ve been treated in accordance with anything, but I’d appreciate some clarity on this? \n Thanks. \n    submitted by    /u/Kilchomanempire  \n [link]   [comments]",

I received a call to say it looked benign but has been marked as suspicious due to it's location - removal and biopsy were recommended. GP took it seriously as they also provide this service and reffered me on the two week pathway.\n I was seen a couple of days ago at the hospital and the doctor couldn't have been more judgemental and dismissive of me using the mole scanning service. Despite admitting he'd never heard of it. Accused it of being some AI app that just increases their workload. I was made to feel like a silly time waster before he'd even examined me.\n When he did examine me, he concluded that my mole was very atypical and suspicious and needed an exision biopsy!!!\n Anyway, this will be done in 2-4 weeks. In the meantime I've been reading about The Mole Clinic which appears very reputable and provides a consultation and exision which is then sent for biopsy on the same day.\n OK, perhaps they still not might be to see me within a week and the NHS time-frame isn't really that bad considering, but then up to another 2 weeks for results. It'll be about a 4-6 wait in total.\n However if I get this done privately then I'll effectively be discharging myself from the NHS clinic which feels super risky. Then, if the mole comes back as cancerous, I'll be screwed because I'm assuming I'd have to be re-referred by my GP? I don't think they'd be happy about that, and then would the hospital clinic even take me back as an urgent referral after binning them off?\n It seems like a bad idea, right?

I’m on a fixed term contract and for whatever reason my initial contract ended on the 28th March and was not extended on ESR till almost the end of this month. This means that I have missed the cut off date for this month’s pay.\n I was told all this was due to delays from execs in signing the business case and several forms that needed approval from different departments such as finance and HR. To me this is non of my fault and have been told that an advance has been submitted but from what I know and what I’ve been told by colleagues is that I will only be paid about half or 60% of the full amount I’m scheduled to get which is a pain.\n I was the advance will be made within 24hrs of payday which is Monday. When questioned whether it is possible to get the full amount or at least confirm the amount I’m getting they seem to deflect both question saying I’ll get it the other amount owed in the my next payslip. Is there any way of me getting the full amount within next week ? \n I’ve just recently moved into an apartment and it requires month in advance and this months rent all together as well as deposit so money is really tight and could do with getting paid the full amount…\n Has anyone had this problem before? Any advice would be appreciated \n Thanks in advance \n    submitted by    /u/KHW6  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was told that I had to complete my second year of service before I'm entitled to two months sick pay, which doesn't make sense as I'd technically be in my third year of service?\n Do I need to complete the entire year of service before I'm entitled to second year service sick leave or am I entitled to that now as I've technically worked here more than 12 consecutive months.\n    submitted by    /u/Royal_Albatross_5152  \n [link]   [comments]",

I spoke to a nurse on the floor of the waiting room I was in about not wanting to stay any longer than I already had, who told me I could sign some self-discharge papers, which I did. Today my final discharge papers from there have come in where it says “patient walked out” under diagnosis. That sounds like I just up and walked out without saying anything to anyone but I’m no healthcare professional so I’m not sure if that’s okay.

He's told me it's not particularly serious in itself, but there is a risk of complications developing in the future.\n The quote from the private clinic is £5000. I have already £1600 saved which was the quoted price of the umbilicoplasty, so to go ahead with this treatment would require me to find £3400 from somewhere.\n My employer doesn't currently provide private health insurance, so if I took out a policy myself, I don't know if this would cover it.\n I have searched for information regarding treating this on the NHS, but from what I can see unless there are actual symptons, this isn't available - can anyone advise?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/LagerBitterCider197  \n [link]   [comments]",

When you just want some idea of what's going on.\n    submitted by    /u/LBP2020  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi so I’m graduating from my Bsc in biomedical science this year, and I’ve applied to the STP for clinical neurophysiology. I was wondering what are my options to continue a career in neuroscience and get lab accredited if I don’t happen to get into the STP? I understand there’s always other masters courses without the clinical training aspect but I really want a career in the NHS and to work in healthcare. Also just fyi my Bsc is not an IBMS accredited degree so I don’t have any certification to work in a lab once I graduate. I feel like the STP is my best chance at kickstarting my career so I need to have a backup if it doesn’t work out this year. Please help! \n    submitted by    /u/smokacola1969  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. \n A benign mass was found in my breast a few months ago but I’m really nervous as I feel like I’m being pushed toward surgery. \n I’ve had appointments set for days I’ve informed the staff I can’t make, appointment times moved without consultation, and they want to make a 5cm incision on my breast (either around my nipple or near my armpit) but won’t tell me where they’re going to cut into me until after I’m under (I’m not a very big person that will be a significant portion of my breast). There’s been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I’ve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn’t use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I’m not even sure if I’m going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I’m really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the “usual surgery risks” (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). \n I’ve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don’t have have savings as they’ve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can’t tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement. I’m incredibly anxious about this whole thing as I don’t really have a support network outside of my care team. If anyone could share their own experiences with breast clinics in the UK I would appreciate it. \n    submitted by    /u/SarcasticBarbie96  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I (30sF) had a relationship for over 10 years with my ex (30sM) broke up 3 years ago.\n It ended badly. He took my home and my possessions. Cheated, was abusive. He sexually assaulted me. I didn't report it, so no official complaint is logged.\n He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.\n Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.\n I soon moved because I didn't want to be anywhere near him.\n He's contacted friends asking where I am.\n My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex's part of the hospital. My relative's mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.\n My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn't understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.\n My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he'd be far enough away and chances low.\n Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.\n More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.\n My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.\n I don't know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.\n Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen? Could this help stop him continuing to contact my family using the hospital?\n Any help is much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/onedaymaybeillknow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks' time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.\n Near the top of the letter is a phone number to 'reschedule or cancel'. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to 'reschedule or cancel', it seems reasonable that if I don't contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there's a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.\n I wasn't sure what to do, so I figured I'd ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven't been able to get through to anyone.\n So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I'm unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?\n I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I've been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I'm terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.\n Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).\n Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.\n    submitted by    /u/permabearish  \n [link]   [comments]",

After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what's causing my stomach pain.\n Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were \"inconclusive.\" I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.\n This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.\n This has been going on for years and I'm frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements.
