          "description": "The World Health Organization (WHO) today released its latest report on antibacterial agents, including antibiotics, in clinical and preclinical development worldwide. Although the number of antibacterial agents in the clinical pipeline increased from 80 in 2021 to 97 in 2023, there is a pressing need for new, innovative agents for serious infections and to replace those becoming ineffective due to widespread use. \nFirst released in 2017, this annual report evaluates whether the current research and development (R&D) pipeline properly addresses infections caused by the drug-resistant bacteria most threatening to human health, as detailed in the  2024 WHO bacterial priority pathogen list (BPPL).

International Humanitarian Law requires all parties to armed conflict to respect and protect humanitarian personnel, including against harassment, mistreatment, and unlawful arrest or detention. \nThe targeting of humanitarian, human rights, and development workers in Yemen must stop. All those detained must be immediately released. \n \nSigned by:\nAchim Steiner, Administrator, UNDP \nAmitabh Behar, Executive Director (interim), Oxfam International\nAudrey Azoulay, Director-General, UNESCO \nCatherine Russell, Executive Director, UNICEF\nCindy McCain, Executive Director, WFP \nInger Ashing, Chief Executive Officer, Save the Children International\nMichelle Nunn, President and CEO, CARE\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, WHO\nVolker Türk, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, OHCHR",
