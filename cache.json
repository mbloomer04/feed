This describes what we will (and won’t) do to meet user needs and organisational goals on the UK’s biggest health website.\n\r\n\r\nPreviously, the roadmap we used internally was more like a Gantt chart than a true roadmap. Each item had a start and an end date and a description of the output, not the outcome.\n\r\n\r\nIn March 2023, we made significant changes to how we created and presented the roadmap. This is how we did it.",
