The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. \n“The new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. “The new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.”\nWHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S.  \nVaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.  \nThere were 473 000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",

My trainer has said the patients were being unreasonable both times, and apart from being \"more polite\" there wasn't any learning to take away. She didn't even recommend writing a reflection on them, which I may do anyway but I'm not sure how to word it? Or what learning I should be taking away?\n The first one: I asked the patient to book another appointment to discuss problem #3 as I had others waiting and had started to run behind. The issue wasn't urgent - I quickly checked red flags and then booked him in for 2 days later. He called later that day, angry that he had to come back in. I thought I'd been pretty polite about it, explained that I needed to take a full history and do another examina…",

I've got an interest in sexual health with a couple of previous GUM jobs during training and have done the DFSRH. A little out of date with it all now, but really enjoyed previous work in this area. \n I'd really appreciate advice from anyone who has made the switch to a specialty (non-training grade) doctor in sexual health, either full-time or alongside GP. Particularly interested in how you ended up in this role, what level of experience is needed, and how I can improve my chances of getting a post. \n If anyone is willing to have a chat or offer some advice on this would be much appreciated.

There seems to be a culture where by medical professionals are not allowed to express evidence led views which go against drug companies. \n Example 1: \n Bunion Repair\n Bunion repair by Bianchi, Italy or Harley Street = No screw, 5 minute procedure, brilliant. No pharma company involved.\n Whilst Bianchi is a superior reoair, standard NHS bunion repair = Invasive procedure using a purchased medical device (screw).\n Example 2:\n Inguinal hernia repair\n Desarda technique = A strip of external oblique is stitched to inguinal ligaments and internal oblique. Wonderful natural muscle graft. \n Whilst desarda is superior, NHS repair = A piece of purchased polypropylene stitched into your abdominal wall. YUCK\n Example 3\n Heart stents = Research shows that the vast majority of operations brought no benefit in stable patients. But the surgeries were arguable performed due to the stents being a medical product was being pushed and purchased. \n Example 4\n Fasting. \n The health benefits are endless. Reverse insulin resistance, autophagy etc etc\n Fasting doesn’t involve any prescriptions, so doesn’t seem to be recommended.\n How many GP’s/consultants prescribe a 10 day fast?\n \n I can go private and see doctors with views that differ from the masses.

It is indeed deplorable that 'people have to die' before anyone takes real notice. But.. but.. that's how the Empire works.

I got offered a post in the South London Deanery, and I could use your expert opinions.\n The first thing that I am worried about is the cost of living. Will I be able to afford to live on my own in London with the salary of an ST3? Seeing that now I am almost 30 years old, I think I am ready to start making a step ahead in my life and try to get my own place. I dread the fact that I might be going into my early 30s and not being able to afford to live on my own. \n The second thing that I would like to ask for your advice on is which areas of London would you advise me to seek a house in. My deanery is going to be in South London, but I have heard rumours that it can be quite dangerous. I have never lived in a dangerous city in the past and I would rather avoid areas with high criminal rates. Which areas would you recommend? Do you think it is a good idea to live above the river and commute every day?\n One final thing that I would like to mention is that currently I am not able to afford a car, as I have spent a fortune on my Royal College exams, courses, study material etc. Will I be able to reach the hospitals in my Deanery using public transport or is owning a car a must?\n Many thanks! xoxo\n    submitted by    /u/DeadlyAssassins9  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like the title says, I’m expecting to be involved in an SI. For obvious reasons I will be very vague about the details. \n My biggest mistake was not documenting that I escalated it to the consultant, because consultants are notoriously bad at documenting their actions thereafter so I guess on paper it looks like I was the last contact with the patient. Before I knew the final patient outcome, I told the consultant about my anxiety around the situation and they said “it’s fine, you escalated it to me, it was my responsibility”, but obviously I didn’t write that on paper and they didn’t document anything after that. \n Fully expecting to be contacted about this case and am beyond anxious about how it will play out. \n I’m a foundation year. Will involvement in something like this affect my future career? \n As soon as I felt out of my depth with the symptoms, that’s when I handed it over to the consultant. Technically the symptom was escalated to me, but I didn’t know what to do so I escalated further. We all know the first month of rotation is very much finding your feet, I had no idea what to do in this specific situation, hence the further escalation as I wasn’t getting anywhere. If something goes wrong, do consultants often field the responsibility and inquests themselves or do they often bounce the blame back at the more junior doctor? \n I’m absolutely terrified and this physical and overwhelming anxiety is enough to make me seriously question a future in this career. I don’t ever want to be involved in this stuff but it seems like perfect storms happen and I fucking hate this \n    submitted by    /u/throwawayclosureex  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a clinical fellow in ED I was making 63k after banding. Like...what is the point in being a salaried GP? \n Like I can genuinely make more than this, if I currently go back to work as a clinical fellow job in Wales,Scotland or NI. It would probably be easier too.\n Last week, my supervisor the other week said to me \"it's true the job market is bad. It's true that you are competing with ARRs roles\". So I have to work super hard for 66-77k. Pathetic. Why not just retrain in literally any speciality in Wales?\n I don't understand. I really like this country and want to work here.

Also find it bizarre most claim not to be trained in taking bloods from children and expect an F1 or any other doctor who doesn’t come across children nearly as much as them to do the bloods instead. Paediatric trainee doctors constantly have to do their own urine dipsticks and observations - can their HCA/nurses not do this? Adult nurses are also busy but they don’t go around saying “im busy I’ll try if I can get round to it” when you ask them to do the most basic thing. Also paediatric nurses when they speak to speciality teams honestly just come across as rude and entitled and quick to behave passive aggressively or straight up rude.

I sat Part A 3 times and passed Part B the first time. Regarding MRCS, I wasn’t alone. I know a lot of my colleagues who also had multiple attempts. Since finishing core surgical training, I have applied to ST3 Trauma and Orthopaedic surgery 3 times. I have been unsuccessful each time. I thought this year was different. I had prepared very well only to be thrown under the bus in the interview. The clinical scenarios were much harder than previous years and I feel like the whole interview process was just poorly delivered. I am also disappointing my family and friends by not getting a training number so the mental toll is a lot. I am planning to give it 1 more shot next year.

But everyone around me (literally every other IMT3 I work with) is hellbent on entering training ASAP as everyone says there won't be any training numbers left soon. Everyone else is off to take ST4 numbers in August. I've taken a more chilled approach this year as it doesn't seem to be quite the mega competition of core training (yet....) and my mental health is sort of in the toilet.\n I'd love 1-2 years out to decompress, see the world, see family, be a normal non doctor human. I'm pre kids so I could have a lot of freedom and nice times. Or I could aim for ST4 next round starting training in Feb 2025 (if I'm lucky, there should be numbers in areas of country I'd like to live in).....\n Is being a consultant lots better? Should I be pushing towards consultancy soon and ending the misery of med reg night shifts and rotating? Or will I be a 35 year old consultant with a couple of kids regretting prioritising my career over a couple of fufilling years out of training?\n I'm female and expect to take a few mat leaves and then LTFT so I suspect I won't get there very fast regardless, it's whether or not I add 1-2 years extra on by taking some time to chill now vs cracking on with HST for a couple years at 100%. We see young people die at work which I think skews my view that life is short and work doesn't matter all that much.\n I'd love to hear from anyone who entered ST4 after a couple of years out, do you regret it now when you see people who were at your stage and are now consultants whilst you're still working nights? Or do you feel lucky that you had amazing experiences that you just can't have in your 40s/50s when tied down by kids and a mortgage?\n P.S.

Is it nodal point 4 because I have three years of psychiatry experience or is it nodal point 8 because I have over seven years of NHS service?

          "description": "I'll start off with fonts and styles. This may be of importance to those doctors whose work is text-intensive and where quality of presentation matters e.g. senior doctors in psychiatry and expert witness doctors. \n In psychiatry the work is text intensive for producing reports of various kinds: Tribunal reports, Managers' reports, CPA, CTR, Court of Protection and so on. Presentancy is 'everything' (chuhknowwhuhahmean). Most 'medics' - or is that doctors - don't give a monkeys about fonts or Styles. Some don't know what's that Style ribbon at the top of MS Word is for, nor do their typists (secretaries or admins). I'm not doing a tutorial on that here. \n What is of relevance is that for the doctors who need to format there work for 'presentancy' and readability (like me) are being told that Trusts require all correspondence to be in Arial 12pt, by policy. No such policy has been found over the last 10 years of me searching for it across 10 Trusts. I dare say it does not exist.\n But wait - I started off with one issue to illustrate something else that happens in your beloved NHS What's that?\n Loads of people make up policies as they go along. The commonest is 'good practice'. Nobody quoting anything of 'good practice' has been able to provide me with a reference to the 'good practice'. \n The other one was \"No patient gets Sectioned unless they have a CTR (care and treatment review).\" No such policy exists in writing anywhere and if it exists it is legally wrong. \n And another, \"Intensive support must be consulted before a LD patient is sectioned\". Doesn't exist. Can't find that anywhere (though it may well exist in a neck of the woods somewhere that I've not been). \n I'd like to hear from those who have witnessed the same sort of making up of policies. \n    submitted by    /u/Capitan_Walker  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyways after resuscitation by the midwife, the buzzer was pulled as baby’s sats were still low despite inflation breaths, NG aspiration of stomach and subsequent face mask O2.\n In response to the buzzer and “paeds” being called, an ACP from paeds attended. She was great, and I learnt stuff from her when I was asking questions about management, and it seemed that everything right was done for baby.\n But an ACP? To essentially a crash call? For adults senior doctors attend. So what is going on here? The ACP seemed quite well versed in everything, but this doesn’t sit right with me. \n There was a point where the ACP said “if things don’t improve by x time, I’m calling my reg”, but why wasn’t a paediatrician there initially? NICU is on the same floor!!! \n I know that even paeds isn’t safe from scope creep and noctors, but can’t we get real doctors to attend to a neonatal emergency.\n Maybe this was because it hadn’t quite gotten to cardiac arrest?

Last week we had a student join us during the morning MDT meeting and introduced herself as a medical student. We did a few cases together during the week and she seemed uninterested in anything I had to teach but was very keen to jump in and take over the patient interviews. I didn't mind her confidence but she took irrelevant histories and didn't seem to understand a lot of basics. She always tried to go out of her way to agree with the consultant and it felt like she was trying to \"one up\" me. It really didn't seem like normal behaviour for a medical student so figured she was just a very driven student who had yet to start her downward journey on the dunning-kruger graph.\n I found out from one of the nurses that she was a nursing student, and was told many of them introduce themselves as medical students, which we agreed was disingenuous. She later confirmed that she would be finishing nursing school soon when asked in front of our MDT.\n I'm not originally from the UK, but is it normal for nursing students to identify themselves as medical students?

But spending months waiting for social issues to sort out, they keep getting new medical issues.\n Plus, there are chronic medical issues that families want taken care of, while they are in the hospital, as an opportunistic bonus.\n Now, its basically just me and a PA (nice but relatively new). Before, it was me and another SHO and we used to divide patients evenly.\n We're being told to prioritize TTOs rather than clinical reviews because pharmacy can't process orders (dosette boxes) in time if we do them after noon\n The issue at hand is that i usually need time to look at a patient my own way, and write in my own style. I'm a bit conscious of making sure that I'm not missing any key details when reviewing a patient, or that any TTO I write is well written.\n Also, the ward manager is insisting that instead of breaking up patients, we divide tasks instead. Things like \"Oh, the PA can write the discharge summary and you can prescribe.....\"\n The PA is a nice lady and she can take bloods decent enough...(somewhat)\n The problem is, I can't review patients late (all the investigation results and imaging gets delayed), and I seriously hate prescribing meds (Especially CDs) when the written portion is a missing key details (like why a drug was discontinued or whether a resus status was changed)\n I take pride in my work, and want to do it in its entirety.\n Does anyone how to handle this kinda workload?\n It's gotten so bad that normally, an MOFD patient is supposed to be reviewed every week just to see if they're ok, and no one's reviewing them for 2-3 weeks.\n    submitted by    /u/hadriancanuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

From 1 October 2022 Officer pension contribution tiers in England and Wales are linked to actual pensionable pay and not the notional full time equivalent rate.\"\n NHSBA seems to suggest differently \"Overtime, in relation to the NHS Pension Scheme, is hours worked in excess of the whole time standard working week. Therefore a part timer’s pensionable pay must include any additional hours worked up to the whole time working week, and hours worked over the whole time working week are not pensionable. For example, if the standard working week is 37.5 hours, a part timer normally working 20 hours a week may pay pension contributions on up to 17.5 additional hours per week.\"\n But then also this from NHSBA? \"The payroll solution must use the previous scheme years actual pensionable earnings to set the member contribution rate (instead of using whole-time equivalent earnings).

I can’t imagine myself in any specialty other than histopath and I am quite set on it but the insane competition ratio is quite disheartening and I feel even with a QIP in pathology, a first author publication (non histopath but is related to another medical specialty) and some teaching experience (delivered occasional teaching here and there but planning on histopath specific ones aimed at FYs) and tasters, I won’t even make it to the interview. So to maximise the points, I was looking at events hosted by RcPath but they seem to be aimed at consultant level doctors rather than suitable for absolute novices like myself.

One of the patients was grateful and very emotional and brought us biscuits as a gesture. When the patient left the clinic, the assistant immediately picked the 3£ gift and went: “Are we even allowed to accept that? I’ll put it in the staff room and you can help yourselves if you want you”\n I mean FFS !!!! Our assistants are so brainwashed from the ridiculously demeaning position of NHS doctors that they would not even have the courtesy to ask permission from the consultant, who the gift is presumably for and who is also in charge of their own clinic, before taking the gift away.\n I did a good job for my patient, my patient expressed their gratefulness by gifting a 3£ biscuit, I felt rewarded that they are grateful- but no, the NHS culture would make sure to remind us that we do not even deserve this gesture.\n I am so fed up with the recurrent manifestations of this upside down hierarchy at the NHS where everyone think, act and actually are the bosses except doctors. I think this culture towards doctors at the NHS is so bad that I doubt reversing it would happen in my lifetime and I would rather run away than spending my career devalued.\n Rant over\n Edit: typos\n    submitted by    /u/DecentTrouble94  \n [link]   [comments]",

The simulator is pretty simple: a mannequin, a monitor, some dummy drugs to be drawn up or checked, some blood gas print outs and people pretending to be nurses, registrars etc. The trainees are final year medical students, FY1s and FY2s. The simulated scenarios are vanilla adult medical and surgical emergencies in which the trainee is called to the ward for a patient that's \"gone off\".\n The scenarios themselves seem pretty realistic and I try to make the debriefings as educational as possible using the After Action Review model, but it seems the trainees get no particular preparation on emergencies before the simulation day and there's no follow up afterwards on lessons identified. It's just one or two simulator days a year in isolation. I've discussed this with the faculty who run the simulator but their view is that preparation and follow up are Someone Else's Problem.\n Has anyone had better experience of sim training than this?\n    submitted by    /u/larus_crassirostris  \n [link]   [comments]",

They stated that since the patient has a junctional tachycardia the treatment of choice is either IV amiodarone or IV flecainide. \n I had a read about junctional tachycardia vs SVT. \n So junctional tachycardia is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR >100. SVT is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR >150. \n I've been trying to find a good paper to explain the management of junctional tachycardias because it sounds a bit different compared with SVT but I can't find anything. One paediatric paper said that we can give amiodarone, another said phenytoin.

It's been praised by both political parties, but criticised by trans groups and international organisations.\n Apart from the merits of these changes, does anyone know why this took the form of an independent service review rather than a national guideline by NICE/ RCPCH/ RCPsych or if there are plans to produce one in the future.

          "description": "Training places \n All specialities will trend towards how neurosurgery is today. Hyper competitive. Virtually impossible to obtain a training number post foundation for many years. This will force more and more doctors into locum work. \n Locum work \n The rise in foundation doctors not getting a training number, previous F3,4,5s etc, and IMGs will saturate the market to the extent that there will be very few locum opportunities, and the rate for locum SHOs will continue to fall. \n Unemployment \n Eventually the market becomes that saturated that essentially as an SHO who has just finished F2. You don’t have enough experience to secure a training number, and there are no locum opportunities. So what do you do? You’re essentially unemployed from a medical point of view. No fellowships, no trust grade jobs. All over subscribed. \n I give it 2-3 years before doctors unemployed in hundreds if not thousands. What can be done? I’m not sure if I’m being honest. I hope the BMA has plans, because honestly this is a much bigger issue than FPR. Actually in effect FPR probably further drives this issue as better pay means less people leave, and it’s more attractive to IMGs that will further up the competition for training numbers and saturate the locum market. (I’m still pro-FPR obviously just looking at it from a different angle 🦀). \n What do people think the answer is?\n All specialities have points in their self scoring for home grad preference? Massive increase in training numbers highly unlikely to happen. Increased number of trust grade jobs? \n I really don’t know. \n    submitted by    /u/Poof_Of_Smoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope you can shine some light on my dilemma. \n I have recently been accepted for an MBA in a top business school with a 50% scholarship - which is still a big investment. For some context, I am an IMG doctor and I co-founded a startup in London after my foundation training which went well but never took off. Last year I decided that it was time to do something different and I applied for the MBA and took a Clinical Fellow post. During my Clinical fellow post (part-time) I rediscovered my passion for medicine and how nice it is to directly help people and I managed to get an IMT spot in the reserve list in an ok location. The MBA would give me a higher salary on a corporate job but it would take me away from medicine and I am not sure I am ready for it! I am thinking about declining or at least trying to defer the MBA offer to next year and do 1 year of IMT to see how I feel. Everyone that I spoke with told me that I would regret my choice and that I am romanticising medicine as I haven't been full-time in a long time. \n I want to hear your opinion on that, especially from doctors and consultants who like what they do.

Staff tell me \"He's still at it.\" So I waited about 10 minutes outside of his room. Someone said I should knock and enter. I did not. I spoke with staff outside of his room for the 10 minutes. Then I had to depart for a meeting as I was now running late. He then opened the door to his room as I was about to depart and seemed to want to talk. I couldn't as I was going to be late for the important meeting. I thought there was a funny side but off course said nothing of the sort.

          "description": "Seems like a lot of people on this subreddit are very pro-CCT and flee, but was curious if most people expressing these views are ST4+? \n Currently an ST1 and training's been alright - it's shielded from a lot of NHS bullshit, but you're still working for the NHS. \n Ophthalmology is switching to a new curriculum next year, but I'm skeptical this will significantly reduce training length. At the moment, I'm anticipating to CCT in probably 7-8 years after all of ST and ?fellowship assuming I stay 100% and pass all my exams/expected competencies in a reasonable time frame. \n I know people have talked about going to Australia or the Middle East, but frankly I'm not that keen on the latter, and if everyone's thinking of going to Australia or Canada after CCT-ing - what is the landscape even going to look like for me when I flee 8 years down the line? 😅 I do predict there will be healthcare shortages, but I would think locally, they'd also be looking to expand medical school/training places to accommodate in the next decade too. Is the prospect of CCT and flee as an ST1 even realistic?\n Also, I know ophthalmology is one of the more lucrative specialties, so surely there must be some barriers in place to emigrating vs a specialty that has a more supportive role (e.g. rads, anaes).\n    submitted by    /u/ophthalmologyornot  \n [link]   [comments]",

They also state because I moved the working weekend I’m not owed a zero day (I moved the weekend before they agreed to give me any zero days at all, so I’d argue if I cancel my swap I need my zero day, then reinstate the swap). Note, the working pattern given above is the original rotation (as if the weekend had not been swapped). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.\n Also, do the swaps also have to comply with rotation rules?

The way our colleagues are treated sucks. What’s the point any more?\n    submitted by    /u/CallObjective69  \n [link]   [comments]",

Luckily, I completed a QIP in this specialty previously but the consultant in-charge is hands-off and slow to reply. \n Long story short, abstract submissions for the last conference I can find that would allow me to present this QIP prior to specialty applications closes soon.

I was looking at ways to bolster my income and fell onto ear syringing. I have good experience in performing it, albeit not having attended any formal courses, and feel it's relatively low risk as I intent to take a good history and ensure I'm not suctioning at a steatoma with my otoscope. A local dental practice I'm on good terms with (not my own dentist) have offered a chair a day a week to run a mini clinic. \n Has anyone got experience in this market? I've been having difficulty finding any real info on indemnity around this. Most of the indemnity products I've found are aimed at companies/clinics with multiple practitioners. Further, does anyone know the situation with making the clinic compliant? I've read about needing CQC approval down south, but again, can't find any info on Scotland. \n Any input is welcome! \n    submitted by    /u/Few_Ad19  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m still disablingly scared of them, even if I’m actually OK on the actual stretch. My current job has quite a few nights but workload is generally okay, so my anxiety is not bad but it’s certainly problematic. I find myself trawling the ED track board for hours before my shift predicting who I might have to see or not. Advice is never too far away but I am so scared of appearing shit that I prepare and over prepare. There really is no point trying to predict referrals as I know what to do with most of them anyway, but it’s a compulsion I can’t stop. \n My next rotation will be in a speciality I have little knowledge on, but I will be covering wards AND referrals overnight. I’m scared I’m going to perpetually be a wreck. I sometimes get fleeting thoughts of calling in sick so I don’t have to deal with it - I never, ever do, but it’s so tempting sometimes that I’m ashamed to say that sometimes the thought lingers a bit too long in my head. \n It doesn’t help that my sleep is almost universally shit on them, and my eating isn’t much better. \n Grateful for any help/tips/reassurance that this can pass, and I can trust myself a bit more. \n    submitted by    /u/Material_Raspberry30  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Yet another incoming FY1 here. Basically I have a 2 year gap between graduating and starting F1 in which I did nothing medicine-related. I feel like I've forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn't that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don't remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.\n Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO's (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I've been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I've also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I've contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? \n Just for a little more info: I’m starting on gen surg. Also I'm hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I'm honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I'm working a 9-5 office job which I'm looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. \n Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I'm ready to put my best foot forward and I’m honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound.

Have learnt this the hard way every year so far as a doctor - nobody wants improvement they only want to perpetuate the status quo and crush any challenge to authority or even open discussion. \n The NHS can have its way and just employ under qualified robots to do it’s willing as per the way of the world these days. Maybe outsource healthcare to a call centre in India? Robot consultations as is the way in the USA. \n Anyway - does anyone actually know a tradesperson earning £50-60k/y? I’d rather cut my losses and go back to college despite having postgrad degrees on top of medical training. \n Has anyone successfully started a business like aesthetics or even non medical and made it succeed? \n Is there any hope at all for the profession because I’m not hearing anything positive at all and it feels very much like the government don’t want or need doctors and in the UK the government IS the NHS. And the overseas market for UK doctors is saturated. \n Do any senior doctors actually want to change the system? And do they understand what your junior ‘colleagues’ are going through (ie not just robots to do what you tell them but also thinking and intelligent humans wish to contribute)? \n    submitted by    /u/Able_Dragonfruit_302  \n [link]   [comments]",

My autism and ADHD impact my presentation of mental health symptoms, and I need lots of additional time to process emotions and information.

There’s been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I’ve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn’t use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I’m not even sure if I’m going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I’m really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the “usual surgery risks” (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). \n I’ve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don’t have have savings as they’ve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can’t tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement.

          "description": "I (30sF) had a relationship for over 10 years with my ex (30sM) broke up 3 years ago.\n It ended badly. He took my home and my possessions. Cheated, was abusive. He sexually assaulted me. I didn't report it, so no official complaint is logged.\n He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.\n Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.\n I soon moved because I didn't want to be anywhere near him.\n He's contacted friends asking where I am.\n My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex's part of the hospital. My relative's mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.\n My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn't understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.\n My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he'd be far enough away and chances low.\n Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.\n More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.\n My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.\n I don't know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.\n Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen? Could this help stop him continuing to contact my family using the hospital?\n Any help is much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/onedaymaybeillknow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks' time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.\n Near the top of the letter is a phone number to 'reschedule or cancel'. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to 'reschedule or cancel', it seems reasonable that if I don't contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there's a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.\n I wasn't sure what to do, so I figured I'd ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven't been able to get through to anyone.\n So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I'm unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?\n I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I've been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I'm terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.\n Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).\n Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.\n    submitted by    /u/permabearish  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, for a few years I've been having recurring abdominal pain, which seems to be chronic gastritis as I have all the symptoms.\n I first brought this up to my GP in 2022, which resulted in me taking prescribed omeprazole for 3 months. After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what's causing my stomach pain.\n Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were \"inconclusive.\" I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.\n This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.\n This has been going on for years and I'm frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements. What can I do??? \n    submitted by    /u/cheappapayasoap  \n [link]   [comments]",
