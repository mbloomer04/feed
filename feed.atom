        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently pivoted and decided to apply for a competitive specialty which I hadn't previously planned for. Luckily, I completed a QIP in this specialty previously but the consultant in-charge is hands-off and slow to reply. 
 Long story short, abstract submissions for the last conference I can find that would allow me to present this QIP prior to specialty applications closes soon. I have tried contacting the consultant and other senior involved many times to ask if they are happy for me to submit an abstract, but they are taking their time to reply (which isn't unusual for them). It's my fault because I'm scrambling to build my portfolio last minute.
 Presuming the consultant doesn't reply to me in time, is it appropriate for me to submit the abstract at the last moment without their permission? 
 I don't know if I'm over thinking it, but this is likely my last and only opportunity to present this QIP to make it count for specialty applications.
 Thank you so much in advance for your advice!!

The big 3 that get mentioned are Unison, Unite and GMB but the thing that's making me hesitate about them is that Unison & Unite seem to list every other hospital profession under the sun specificaly as staff they cater to but ward clerks are lumped into the 'and other admin staff' category; and GMB seems to be workers in general with no specialisation. On one hand I get it, ward clerks are comparatively low in numbers compared to most other hospital roles, but on the other hand I want to know that a union will be looking out for us just as much as they do for the roles with big numbers.
 Open to any advice on which union might be best for ward clerks and if there's any other unions to suggest please do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I was in a diagnostic session with the consultant psychiatrist in my local NHS recovery team. My GP referred me to them for a PTSD diagnosis, CPA, talking therapies, and medication advice.
 I was taken aback during the latest session when the psychiatrist began really pushing me to look at going privately for talking therapies.
 I get that the NHS is crumbling - I work in the same NHS Trust - but it felt really wrong to me that an NHS professional should advocate for going against the founding principles of the NHS.
 Does anyone else feel that this is unethical?
 —
 Extra information: I have the distinct impression that the recovery service really doesn’t want to take me on because I need significant reasonable adjustments to their usual ways of working. My autism and ADHD impact my presentation of mental health symptoms, and I need lots of additional time to process emotions and information. The local IAPT straight up rejected me as ‘too complex,’ and told my GP to send me to recovery. But it feels that rather than adapt and adjust, recovery want to find any reason to reject me too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 Longtime lurker posting on a throwaway. 
 I'm an SHO grade doc working in Scotland just now. I was looking at ways to bolster my income and fell onto ear syringing. I have good experience in performing it, albeit not having attended any formal courses, and feel it's relatively low risk as I intent to take a good history and ensure I'm not suctioning at a steatoma with my otoscope. A local dental practice I'm on good terms with (not my own dentist) have offered a chair a day a week to run a mini clinic. 
 Has anyone got experience in this market? I've been having difficulty finding any real info on indemnity around this. Most of the indemnity products I've found are aimed at companies/clinics with multiple practitioners. Further, does anyone know the situation with making the clinic compliant? I've read about needing CQC approval down south, but again, can't find any info on Scotland. 
 Any input is welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently a CT1 in surgery and I’m four years into medicine. I’ve done nights regularly for three of the four years. I’m still disablingly scared of them, even if I’m actually OK on the actual stretch. My current job has quite a few nights but workload is generally okay, so my anxiety is not bad but it’s certainly problematic. I find myself trawling the ED track board for hours before my shift predicting who I might have to see or not. Advice is never too far away but I am so scared of appearing shit that I prepare and over prepare. There really is no point trying to predict referrals as I know what to do with most of them anyway, but it’s a compulsion I can’t stop. 
 My next rotation will be in a speciality I have little knowledge on, but I will be covering wards AND referrals overnight. I’m scared I’m going to perpetually be a wreck. I sometimes get fleeting thoughts of calling in sick so I don’t have to deal with it - I never, ever do, but it’s so tempting sometimes that I’m ashamed to say that sometimes the thought lingers a bit too long in my head. 
 It doesn’t help that my sleep is almost universally shit on them, and my eating isn’t much better. 
 Grateful for any help/tips/reassurance that this can pass, and I can trust myself a bit more.

That said, I really want the Oxford University Hospitals rotation. I am just wondering how it all works. Am I able to apply to both and see which rotation I get before accepting my offer? Or is it deaneries first and then you choose your rotation and get allocated according to rank like the FY programme? I would take virtually anywhere in Wales tbh but if I knew for sure I’d been allocated OUH’s rotation in Thames Valley, I’d take that instead. Appreciate that this is all hypothetical and at the end of the day I’d take any post I get regardless but just wondering how it works. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yet another incoming FY1 here. Basically I have a 2 year gap between graduating and starting F1 in which I did nothing medicine-related. I feel like I've forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn't that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don't remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.
 Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO's (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I've been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I've also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I've contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? 
 Just for a little more info: I’m starting on gen surg. Also I'm hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I'm honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I'm working a 9-5 office job which I'm looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. 
 Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I'm ready to put my best foot forward and I’m honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound. Thank you so much🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, incoming fy1 here interested in physics, maths and engineering related specialties. What sort of pathway could I go down to explore these topics more in medicine? I understand radiology has a decent amount of physics and there’s certain specialties like nuclear medicine to consider, both of which interest me a lot. I am just wondering what other things I could be doing alongside going into these specialties that could get me into a field that has a decent balance of medicine and physics/engineering. I have considered PhD programs to do with biomedical engineering that might lend to a more academic career, or ones that I could do alongside my radiology training, would like to know more about this.
 Would love to know if anyone here has gone down such a route or if anyone knows anything about it. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People ask me what I want to specialize in and I say Histopath with rads in close second and the first question they have is about AI and that diagnostic rads and histopath may become obsolete with AI. From what I have seen so far from tasters in both specialties, AI is nowhere near even replacing doctors in rads or path and the clinical context is super important when producing reports of either CT scans or reporting microscopic slides which I don’t see AI deal with the nuances of anytime soon. I get asked this question so much that I feel it probably may even end up being an interview question when I make my application. But at the same time because I get asked this question a lot (by other doctors), perhaps there is some truth to it?
 What do the radiologists and pathologists here have to say about this? Interested in hearing your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I am not a consultant/GP, have been qualified and working as a doctor for 7 years. Will be keeping this vague for identifiability purposes.
 A friend of mine runs a food and drink business. They're expanding to several other countries after some success in the UK, including the USA, Europe, and Asia.
 One of the regulatory bodies has different allergen standards (I.e. acceptable concentrations), which has highlighted some issues and changes they'll have to make to sell some of their food there.
 They're looking for a doctor to essentially take the info regarding some of these issues, collate some evidence around them, and sort of explain it all to the board of their company, and attempt to quantify some risks for them. Not to necessarily say "this is medically fine" or "go full steam ahead with production", but more to explain some of the issues from a medical standpoint and the repercussions should something go wrong.
 Any risk would theoretically be covered by their indemnity and lawyers, and a document would be prepared stating that they've consulted a doctor for advice but that the company is entirely responsible and culpable for their own decisions
 My questions boil down to is this an acceptable thing to do? 
 I'm not an expert in any regard, and I'm still a junior doctor. They're asking because we are friends is all.
 Is there anyone out there who's done something similar for a company/in a commercial setting? Would it be bonkers to consider doing this (essentially it boils down to a literature review turned to lay language)? Would an indemnity provider like MDU have specialised cover for this sort of thing or?

 I have been in a long term relationship throughout med school with my partner who I am now culturally/ traditionally married to. We just haven’t done a religious / white wedding yet . We were planning on doing this April 2025
 I have just found out I am pregnant. This was not planned and is coming as a total shock/surprise . Yes we did use contraception but as I have learnt these can also fail My husband is very supportive and I know he will be a great dad
 I am just very anxious about it all. I am wondering if starting f1 whilst pregnant is a good idea . I am a graduate student so having a baby was definitely a plan in the near future . Initially taking a year out after F1 or F2
 I am also worried on the financial strain this will put on my husband as by the time I am due I will not be entitled to the nhs maternity pay 
 I am just wondering if I should just postpone f1 to next year altogether? My due date at the moment is late December/ early Jan so I could technically finish the first rotation 
 Fy1 is already hard enough and I’m just worried I will not be able to cope.

 Please help us understand your views and experiences in relation to the role of Physician Associates (PAs) in general practice settings by completing our survey by Fri 10th May.
 The survey has been developed by the RCGP, following direction from RCGP Council, but is being conducted independently by Research by Design, an independent research agency.
 Your response will help us to understand more about how PAs are currently working in general practice as well as GP views on the benefits and challenges associated with this. We are also seeking your input on what framework and parameters should be in place to ensure that PAs working in general practice can do so safely and effectively, and what guidance is needed from RCGP.
 I know you're all really busy, but the survey should only take 20–25 minutes to complete, and is really important, so please do take part if you can. We are keen to hear from as many members as possible to ensure we can gain a good understanding of views across the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With everything going around the media and forums I’m at a crossroads - nearly finished training and getting on a bit age wise. 
 Probably going to complete training and leave the profession because I’ve realised that nothing will ever change no matter how hard I work and whatever I do to try to make the system better will just cause push back on me - so there’s no point. Have learnt this the hard way every year so far as a doctor - nobody wants improvement they only want to perpetuate the status quo and crush any challenge to authority or even open discussion. 
 The NHS can have its way and just employ under qualified robots to do it’s willing as per the way of the world these days. Maybe outsource healthcare to a call centre in India? Robot consultations as is the way in the USA. 
 Anyway - does anyone actually know a tradesperson earning £50-60k/y? I’d rather cut my losses and go back to college despite having postgrad degrees on top of medical training. 
 Has anyone successfully started a business like aesthetics or even non medical and made it succeed? 
 Is there any hope at all for the profession because I’m not hearing anything positive at all and it feels very much like the government don’t want or need doctors and in the UK the government IS the NHS. And the overseas market for UK doctors is saturated. 
 Do any senior doctors actually want to change the system? And do they understand what your junior ‘colleagues’ are going through (ie not just robots to do what you tell them but also thinking and intelligent humans wish to contribute)?

 Have been thinking about future career prospects and having done further reading, ophthalmology seems interesting. Problem comes with the fact I have done basically nothing in medical school other than pass my exams ☹️ (no awards/poster presentations). I realise and am willing to put in a lot of work during my foundation training. Question is: is it possible? And if so, where do I start?
 Would appreciate any help/advice that you guys can offer!

 Should I be feeling this insecure so close to the end? 
 Still find myself making silly mistakes, nothing untoward happening to the patients but still dumb mistakes/oversights that I catch later and spend the day ruminating about. 
 I get good feedback from juniors and consultants but I don’t think they tend to notice what I’m up to being a senior trainee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had the pleasure at working at many different hospitals. Which means I've worked with many different blood transfusion labs and feel that their approach to group and save samples is incredibly hard-line. 
 At this point, I'd like to point out I am very aware of what I'm asking for when I request a blood transfusion and I do have a genuine appreciation for the risks involved and for the potential for catastrophic mishaps.
 However, I've seen multiple occasions where samples have been rejected (often at the disservice of the patient) for extremely rigid rules that are completely inflexible. This leads to repeated stabs which are unpleasant for the patient or, at its worst, a delay in transfusion of cross matched blood. 
 What are your feelings on the threshold for rejecting G&S samples?

In the BMA MAP scope, it says teaching is not to happen unless it falls within the safe parameters of working for MAPS. Does this mean things both within the green and orange boxes?
 For example, in psych, the green for MAPS is physical healthcare related only. So does this mean PA can teach related to performing a physical exam, but shouldn’t be teaching things like MSE/History taking? 
 Likewise, O&G, orange box is refit or replace vaginal pessaries. Can they be teaching doctors how to do so?
 Has anyone been asked to arrange teaching programmes involving PA as educators and if so how have you organised this so it’s appropriate?

The case that you are reflecting on is [insert scenario] and the learning points that you want to take away are [insert learning points]. The reflective piece should be between 500-1000 words and should be based on the Gibbs reflective cycle. Keep a professional tone but inject some evidence of empathy throughout the text” 
 I’ve been getting middling results with this and was wondering if anyone has any pointers on how to improve the prompt? 
 Edit: totally on board with the responses about 500-1000 words being way too long. My initial plan was to just pad it with so much stuff nobody would bother reading it to be honest!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! My question is as above. We are an IMG couple and is my husband is applying to FY2 Standalone Program which will start this August 2024. I plan to apply for the 2nd round of GP training which will open on July and will start Feb. 2025. 
 Is it feasible that we both do this if we have a 5 year old child? And we will all be moving to the UK mid-July before FY2 starts. 
 I’m concerned regarding our schedule and it its feasible to manage being hands-on with our son or if it would be very busy and if its advisable I apply to GP training once my husband is done with FY2. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was assigned a community placement in psychiatry for my GP training. When I tried to get a fob to access the car park, I was told that because I'm only there for 4 months, I'm not eligible for a fob. When I asked the admin team where I was supposed to park, they told me to park on the roads nearby. The placement is in quite a deprived area, and I didn't feel comfortable parking on the roads a few minutes walk away. So I parked in the patients' car park a few times, and was issued a £100 fine.
 I ended up telling the consultant that I'm under about the whole situation, and he was very indignant about it. Sent an email to the admin team straightaway and I got a car park fob the next day. In hindsight, should have told the consultant about it a lot sooner.
 Just really nice to have your consultant stick up for you!

 However the simplest service step of just saying, 'the wait will be about 30 minutes, you need to wait for the doctor', or even 'the wait could be 4 hours because we only have 1 ### but you need to be here in case we get you in earlier'. 
 People just want to know something, so they can relax. But you're forced to awkwardly approach staff milling about and ask, which makes you look impatient. When you just want some idea of what's going on.

I was wondering what are my options to continue a career in neuroscience and get lab accredited if I don’t happen to get into the STP? I understand there’s always other masters courses without the clinical training aspect but I really want a career in the NHS and to work in healthcare. Also just fyi my Bsc is not an IBMS accredited degree so I don’t have any certification to work in a lab once I graduate. I feel like the STP is my best chance at kickstarting my career so I need to have a backup if it doesn’t work out this year. Please help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. 
 A benign mass was found in my breast a few months ago but I’m really nervous as I feel like I’m being pushed toward surgery. 
 I’ve had appointments set for days I’ve informed the staff I can’t make, appointment times moved without consultation, and they want to make a 5cm incision on my breast (either around my nipple or near my armpit) but won’t tell me where they’re going to cut into me until after I’m under (I’m not a very big person that will be a significant portion of my breast). There’s been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I’ve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn’t use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I’m not even sure if I’m going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I’m really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the “usual surgery risks” (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). 
 I’ve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don’t have have savings as they’ve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can’t tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement. I’m incredibly anxious about this whole thing as I don’t really have a support network outside of my care team. If anyone could share their own experiences with breast clinics in the UK I would appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (30sF) had a relationship for over 10 years with my ex (30sM) broke up 3 years ago.
 It ended badly. He took my home and my possessions. Cheated, was abusive. He sexually assaulted me. I didn't report it, so no official complaint is logged.
 He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.
 Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.
 I soon moved because I didn't want to be anywhere near him.
 He's contacted friends asking where I am.
 My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex's part of the hospital. My relative's mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.
 My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn't understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.
 My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he'd be far enough away and chances low.
 Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.
 More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.
 My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.
 I don't know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.
 Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen? Could this help stop him continuing to contact my family using the hospital?
 Any help is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks' time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.
 Near the top of the letter is a phone number to 'reschedule or cancel'. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to 'reschedule or cancel', it seems reasonable that if I don't contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there's a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.
 I wasn't sure what to do, so I figured I'd ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven't been able to get through to anyone.
 So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I'm unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?
 I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I've been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I'm terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.
 Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).
 Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, for a few years I've been having recurring abdominal pain, which seems to be chronic gastritis as I have all the symptoms.
 I first brought this up to my GP in 2022, which resulted in me taking prescribed omeprazole for 3 months. After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what's causing my stomach pain.
 Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were "inconclusive." I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.
 This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.
 This has been going on for years and I'm frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements. What can I do???

I've been at my current doctors for 5 years & they're aware of my medical history. It says medical Condition 0. 
 I asked my doctors & they asked me to put it in writing which I did. Does anyone know how long it will take to get my full medical history from birth if possible? Because I was really sick as a child. My mum told me had different medical issues which I later found out I didn't. thank you.
 Thank you to everyone. I have my medical records now. 163 pages.

 It seems GP across the country is in a dire situation, but I have been told it is "better" in London. 
 For fully qualified GP's who are and have been working in London...
 How is it? 
 Is it sustainable? 
 Are there more "opportunities", private or otherwise? 
 Do you get paid (alot) more in London? 
 Are there more partnership opportunities? How about getting into other industries such as branching into health tech / pharma? 
 Or perhaps going into more public health / regulation / policy? 
 For those outside of London, is it as bad as the press says it is? GPs going to food banks, or going to 
 I think the recent issues in GP have been making me strongly consider whether to remain in training or leave to enter a different speciality. 
 I figured getting some objective truth / advice from fellow GPs on here would be helpful.

I’m UK trained and CCT’d in Feb 2024. I hadn’t been told re: being on the PL as a registrar so tried to apply as qualified since mid January. Initially PCSE website was down so couldn’t do it, then my account got frozen and unusable, it took 6 weeks of emails and phone calls for them to sort. I finally got application put through and have been waiting another few weeks since. All this while, I managed to get a job on OOH bank contract but am being told I’m not allowed to take any work with them until on PL. I’m also concerned if this drags on further they’ll terminate my contract. I engaged BMA before but hasn’t seemed to help. I’m now almost 3 months post CCT and it’s causing me loss of income- I’ve drawn on savings for mortgage etc but the whole thing has impacted my finances and I’m pretty angry. Any help/advice much appreciated sorry if this comes across as ranty!

I am currently in Japan and have been here for the past 3 months, absolutely love the people and the culture, and planning to travel for least 12 months. I don’t want to keep coming back to uk and locuming for a couple of weeks and heading out again. Then it hit me , why not work remotely using a VPN . There must be way right, I mean we are living in 2024 not 1980, the world is so connected now. I heard that indemnity can be a headache ? I don’t understand why tho. What’s the difference between speaking to a patient in Japan as opposed to in my living room , if makes no sense to me. Has anyone done this ? Would really like to hear your thoughts. Thanks all 🙏

 I apologise for asking such a blunt question, but I’ve always wondered about this and wondered if anyone can inform me. 
 I always think about the paramedic who informed me that my Mum had passed away, many years ago. She died in a very upsetting and traumatic way, and from what I understand, the visual would have been really upsetting. I did not see her. 
 I always think of him and I wonder what kind of support he would have been given. Is there an official process? Is there mandatory counselling given after incidents like this? 
 Thank you in advance, and apologies for the morbid question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a medical exemption card. When I went to get a prescription earlier, they said ‘and you have a pre-paid certificate right?’ And I said ‘no I have a medical exemption’ and they looked puzzled and said they have me down as pre-paid certificate. I showed my card, they then entered the correct type and all was fine. 
 What has now worried me is I’ve collected prescriptions a couple of times from here previously, one last week and one in January. I’m pretty sure I showed my card then or said I had a medical exemption. Any chance they wrote down the wrong type at one point and now that’s stored on my file? Could I get penalised by the NHS BSA if it looks like l’ve claimed on this when I haven’t? Maybe they’d see if I have a medical exemption and it’d be ok, but not sure how their checking system works. 
 I will go into the pharmacy tomorrow just to check with them, but thought I’d ask on here as it’s causing a little anxiety. Thank you

 Accepted on upcoming Aug entry to GPST. I already have my locality.
 I'm looking to get a mortgage. The broker says they need a contract prior to AIP/offer. Does anyone have past experience with when we would receive an offer (I'd imagine it might be very late) or any other advice regarding this.
 I would imagine even the specialist brokers for doctors would require a contract.

 When you speak to the patient, a good proportion won’t have actually seen a doctor: - Some of them went to their practice nurse for a routine checkup - Some of them went to one of the PA or ACPs - Some of them called up their GP and couldn’t get past the “go to A&E if you think it’s an emergency”
 Anyone else noticed this/got any thoughts? You never actually went to your GP, but it all gets lumped together as “why has their GP sent them in for THAT?!?!l 
 (Obviously goes without saying that shit and/or GPs exist, and everyone’s guilty of an embarrassing referral)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Wanted to get thoughts from people.
 I'm entering GP training in August. I really wanted an A&E rotation as I want to work in A&E occasionally as a GP. I'm interested in managing minor injuries, suturing, procedures etc. I know a lot of this is done by non doctors but I wanted to build up experience so I can do a lot of OOH work as a GP. However, I didn't get my chosen ED rotation as there were only 3 to choose from...
 Does this limit my ability once I'm qualified if I wanted to spend a decent amount of time in ED as a GP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new oral vaccine for cholera has received prequalification by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 April. The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. 
“The new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. “The new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.”
WHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S.  
Vaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.  
There were 473 000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a GPST1, relatively de-skilled re asthma management and COPD as we have respiratory nurses that do the most of it. 
 ​
 I got confused re-dosages, escalation policy and when to use what 
 Nice/BTS/GINA State different things and dosages : so my questions are 
 ​
 -Any simplified escalation policy including dosages involved? 
 -Maximal dose of steroid per day (GINA states 2000, BTS/NICE 1000) 
 -Maximal dose of LABA. It's officially 46 for Formoterol, but saw patients using more. 
 -What do you give if patient is on Fostair and reached 8 puffs a day (=maximal dose of Formoterol 46mcg) and you wish to increase his inhaled steroids 
 -role of muntelukast in this story 
 -role of anti histamins (as resp nurses gives it at times as well) 
 -would you give combined LABA+Steroid(e.g. fostair) and also reliever therapy as salbutamol of not well controlled on maximal dose?
 ​
 Your help is IMMENSLY appreciated!

 Also if there’s any that are not only useful but also CV boosters that would help too!

If I try to open a PDF it's russian roulette whether or not my screen will hang, and don't even get me started on the arachaic Word referral doc system we still have going because that's another rant in itself...
 I looked at "My Computer" the other day and saw that the PC I use has 8GB RAM. My iPhone has 6GB of RAM and all I use that for is reddit and ignoring my emails, but I digress.
 I found this the other day. An 8GB RAM upgrade for the PC I'm using. This would double my RAM, quadrouple my productivity and probably cure the viral URTI of the patient sitting in front of me if it tried hard enough - and all for the low, low price of £16.94.
 So tell me, someone, anyone, please, why shouldn't I just purchase this and install it onto my practice PC? It would cost me less than a nice take-out dinner and serve me righteously for years to come!
 (PS: Do you think I would have to run this by the IT guy or do you think it's cool if I just open 'er up and giv'r? Srs answers only plz.)
