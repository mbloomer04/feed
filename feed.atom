        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Just trying to seek some advice or information on this issue I’m currently experiencing. I’m on a fixed term contract and for whatever reason my initial contract ended on the 28th March and was not extended on ESR till almost the end of this month. This means that I have missed the cut off date for this month’s pay.
 I was told all this was due to delays from execs in signing the business case and several forms that needed approval from different departments such as finance and HR. To me this is non of my fault and have been told that an advance has been submitted but from what I know and what I’ve been told by colleagues is that I will only be paid about half or 60% of the full amount I’m scheduled to get which is a pain.
 I was the advance will be made within 24hrs of payday which is Monday. When questioned whether it is possible to get the full amount or at least confirm the amount I’m getting they seem to deflect both question saying I’ll get it the other amount owed in the my next payslip. Is there any way of me getting the full amount within next week ? 
 I’ve just recently moved into an apartment and it requires month in advance and this months rent all together as well as deposit so money is really tight and could do with getting paid the full amount…
 Has anyone had this problem before? Any advice would be appreciated 
 Thanks in advance

 I'm a FY2 and always wanted to learn how to titrate NIV settings. Unfortunately haven't had a resp job and the nurses at the hospital I'm based at tend to adjust the settings very well on their own for the most part. It's really nice of them but I feel it's a gap in my knowledge I want to address.
 I have nights coming up where I will be covering the resp ward. Whilst the safe thing I am going to do is run past any NIV patients and ABGs I'm unsure about with the reg, I would be grateful if anyone could give their recommendations on how to go about learning NIV settings and adjusting them based on the blood gases? Also how it's decided to wean patients off NIV and how to go about that.
 Any books or resources would be great! Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have my concerns that the PA argument is becoming monopolised by Twitter fame-hungry accounts using a serious issue- in my opinion one of the most pressing facing our profession- as a vehicle for attention.
 It is concerning to see this ongoing. For example: browsing Twitter this morning, there is a prominent account- that shall remain anonymous- who regularly posts wide reaching, anti PA rhetoric. “Great”, you might think.
 Unfortunately; they also post a lot of nonsense. In the last month they have claimed to have been born and grown up in a working class council estate in the north of England, and a couple of weeks later claimed to have been an immigrant from another country moving here for university.
 I’m worried that, when unverified, popular, but questionable accounts (unclear if they are even genuinely a junior doctor) take charge of an important message like that on PAs, their own suspicious activity will damage the message they become so closely tied to.
 Can the BMA do more to advertise that they should be the official spokes people on PA matters in the same way they have been so successfully for strikes?
 This movement is too important to get brought down by questionable characters harnessing it for their own media profile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a recently CCTd GP
 I was given an insurance form to do for a patient I have reviewed 1-2 times. It was an insurance form for the pt to buy a house/get home insurance (which I didn't have to when I bought a house but the request seemed legitimate)
 I tried to complete the form as accurately as possible. But some questions required much more information than I could realistically process or document or the form. So I wrote 'see full medical records
 This was then queried, so i said can attach full medical record if the patient consents.
 But I feel this might have been the wrong advice. A) don't think should really be providing full medical records to insurance companies unless patients really request it B) think if so, would need to go through the notes and redact any 3rd party info. 
 I'm not sure how to rectify this situation. It was only a few days ago - so i will ask team not to contact pt/release any info. And I can suggest that the form needs repeating.
 But I'm not sure how to complete the form. I can't realistically document every episode of a certain condition/every consultation re this over time.
 Grateful for any advice on how to proceed
 Tia

 This particular specialty has given the first round of offers for 100-110 posts only. Will that number increase over the course? How does it actually work?

 A patient was leaving ED and kicking up a fuss as their phone went missing. They were annoying but not ultimately rude/aggressive. They kept pressing me so I just said “do I look like lost and found?” And walked away
 Another (within earshot) informed me (rudely) that if they weren’t seen in 10minutes they were leaving. I explained the wait time was approximately 9 hours and she huffed and left. More almost turning to the people beside her in the waiting room I just vented and said “wow, what a crying shame” as she left
 All in all not very big but I had a couple of complaints from the ward which weren’t so bad

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bring back paternalistic medicine! 
 Patients don't always know what is best for them. Quite frankly a lot of the general public don't have enough knowledge to be able to properly weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of complex treatment options, and we don't have the time to fully explain things in a way that these people will understand. We should make the decision and present the best option to them. I've seen too many patients recently make stupid choices regarding treatment because they don't understand the chances of success and failure. 
 Example: Experienced vascular consultant gives patient option A and option B. Option A is to do partial foot amputation. Consultant informs patient that the resulting wound is extremely unlikely to heal due to PVD and that they will almost definitely need to return to surgery to do below knee amputation. Option B is to go straight to below knee amputation which will result in less time in hospital overall. Patient discussed with surgeon and agrees option B. Then family show up and are informed of plan and say "No, absolutely not. We want a second opinion". Patient then doesn't want to upset family and decides to choose option A. Patient has surgery, surgery fails, patient returns to theatres several weeks later. Leg is chopped off. Length of stay is longer. NHS has spent all the extra money of the first surgery for no reason. 
 Surely it would have been better for the consultant to say "This is the surgery that we need to do. It is the only option. Anything less will fail and I will not do pointless operations that have an extremely small chance of success*"?
 *Unless lack of treatment would result in certain death anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[F2 here. Idk if I am alone in feeling this way. I work hard on my days I am at work including my current anaesthetics job where I ask loads of questions and if sent on a coffee break (too frequent for me but the anaesthetist seems to get grumpy with me if I don’t take the coffee break so I just take them whenever they tell me) I will be doing some reading such as UWorld questions. On my days off, I feel like I have to be doing something that is related to work/medicine (such as QIP, Audit, studying for exams, working on portfolio and thinking about further training and how I go about it). And if I do try to go somewhere nice on my days off, midway I will feel bad and unproductive and will change my course to back home to do something medicine related. I constantly feel like an imposter and still wonder how I even became a doctor as there is still loads I don’t know. The only thing I don’t feel bad about is the gym or cooking food and cleaning. 
 Anyone else feel this way?

I tried to explain to them the concept of a PA, and their brains couldn't grasp it, one dr (with her broken English) said she didn't see the point of the PA with the role they have Oh one more thing, bring back the white lab coats that we once wore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started on my F2 GP rotation and been seeing patients for 2 weeks. I ensure I discuss most patients with the GPs to double check my plans or if I am unsure of what is going on. Despite this, I have found that I have already made 2 mistakes so far. One of them is a prescribing one where I prescribed a longer course of a medication than recommended as I think I misunderstood the GP's advice, I fortunately picked up on it when reading yesterday and will call the patient to let them know before it has any impact on them but this has made me anxious and underconfident. I have very rarely made an impactful mistake in hospital and I unfortunately have this overthinking habit so I struggle with uncertainty and will read up about anything I am unsure about after a work day to learn from it and as a coping mechanism. The downside to this is that I end up identifying issues more than my peers and while this helps patients, it also makes me doubt myself and I worry about my patients and the GPs losing trust in me. I wonder if there is any way to manage these feelings of guilt and under-confidence for doctors who have been in this situation before? Thank you so much

 I have two close friend's weddings abroad, in the same week, which I'm looking at taking annual leave for in September. Just wondering how likely it is that I would be able to take five back-to-back days of leave so I can attend both events? Or is it worth just requesting a couple of days and choose which one attend? I'll be working on acute med if it makes any difference. Thanks!!

I'm still on the wait list and it was estimated to be around August that the appointment would come through. However, I am now going abroad for work temporarily, so if I do get an appointment before October I won't be able to attend the appointment. Is it possible to be put back on the wait list, or will they cancel my appointment all together?

Marvel as we apply years of medical training to a task so crucial, it can only be entrusted to those with an MBBS—no mere mortal staff could possibly click checkboxes with such precision. Forget the quaint notions of clinics and actual patient interaction; our nimble fingers are destined for the keyboard, crafting these digital epics in a blistering 3-5 minutes each. So on those rare, well-staffed days ripe for learning, remember, the true educational summit is not in the clinic, but in the glow of the discharge summary screen. All hail the medical scribes of the 21st century!

Turns out to be a UTI and responds to abx. Seems like they’ve overcooked it with a frail patient with hypoactive delirium and a clear infective cause. Probably causing some lasting harm from ICU. And had an MRIH, EEG, CTH, CTAP, and POCUS in the process.
 Maybe it’s easy to say in hindsight but I would think we would approach this quite differently in the UK. Thoughts?

I tried to apply for a job that was posted on day X stating that the deadline was for day X+13, and the application was closed on day X+2.
 P.S. I know they have the right to do so, but I read that they are obligated to state on the job offer that should the maximum number of applications be reached, the advert will be closed, which was not the case for me (I came across a couple of other job offers who stated so and I rushed to apply).

 One of the questions is asking for post type or appointment. The options are LAT, Military, Substantive and Visitor. Which one do I pick? Is IMT classed as Substantive.

I have applied for this opening via trac jobs.
 However, I've been contacted by certain recruiters on linkedin in the past few days, offering to discuss opportunities they have with the NHS. I've told them that I have an offer, and that the CoS is currently being processed. Then they've begun offering the possibility of quicker processing and deployment. They've also asked me to send them my CV, which I have not done as of writing.
 Is it possible at all for legitimate NHS recruitment/application to be done outside trac? Moreover, with the recent change in immigration policies, how can they guarantee people with quicker processing times?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a CT1 in psychiatry, a friend of mine tends to complain about psychiatrists all the time. And I can feel that she feels distasteful about me ever since I’ve started in Psych. 
 I love Psychiatry, and I want to continue doing it. But even in the hospitals I have noticed that our patients are not very fond of us, most of dislike us. Which to me is understandable, since we section them, give them depots. 
 After this I made a mistake of looking it up online- why do people hate psychiatrists, and I found so much hate. 
 This makes me miss my rotations in medicine, because I felt more appreciated and rewarded by the patients. However, in psychiatry it’s just soo common to go through racial abuse, verbal abuse, threats, and I can go on and on.
 I don’t know, what is your take on it? Will appreciate some opinions on this, as again I feel very passionate about it, but all this hate is getting to me.

Apparently the Care inspectorate is coming round and without such forms SW will be in big trouble. 
 I comforted them with explaining that I will be standing with them in commiseration but certainly would not entertain issuing section 47 forms to capacitous adults who make a decision to seek help from carers.
 I did have a few months ago a conversation with the mental welfare commission who was very clear that asking for help with eg tablet counting, assembling of doses or even asking for complete taking over of sorting the meds is entirely compatible with having capacity. 
 SW is of course heart broken about my attitude. 
 Any useful thoughts?

 However, it is far from my partner and my family. Partner has her own work and it's now dawning upon us that the move may not be that easy.
 I have seen the form on ORIEL whereby you can reapply to continue your training in another region whereby you continue at ST4. In essence, you reapply in open competition with the only difference being you have to upload a form with your current TPD supporting your application.
 My issue now is, is it worth doing this? The application window for the speciality basically opens up at the same time I start ST3 in October. Does it look bad approaching TPD to ask him to sign the form at the start of my training? Will he think badly of this. And say I am not successful in reapplying, will the current TPD then screw me over for the rest of my rotations thinking this person didn't even want to be here in the first place?
 Some of my friends are saying it's worth reapplying in open competition whilst retaining my NTN. But I am scared if I don't get in, I will set off on a bad foot with the TPD of the current region which I would then be stuck in for the rest of my training. I don't know how TPDs respond to this

 There were no GP appointments the day before and 111 didn't get back to her so she was lost on a weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. My name has roots in a language that's quite different from English. People who don't know this language can't pronounce my name correctly not because it’s hard to pronounce but because they read it literally. It's like how the Slovak name "Jana" would be pronounced "Yana" in English. Up until now, I never corrected my colleagues and patients to pronounce my name as it's spelled, but that's not how it's really pronounced, and I wonder whether I should start correcting them (as I am starting to feel a bit uncomfortable). People don’t get my name right at first attempt, and when my colleagues are present, they often correct my pronunciation of my name (me: “I’m Jana” … someone “sorry what’s your name again?” … my colleague “Yana”… someone “Ah okay I got it! Nice to meet you, Yana”) 
 Would it be too complicated to introduce myself by saying, "The spelling is Jana, but the pronunciation is Yana"? Should I change the spelling on my yellow badge to match the pronunciation (“Yana”)? What do other people in similar situations do? Should I accept how others call me so as not to complicate my life?

 This may possibly be a silly question. I'm a current GPST3 eyeing up options for work after qualifying.
 Is it possible to work at two different practices as a salaried GP at both? E.g. Monday Tuesday at practice A, Wednesday Thursday at practice B?
 Would this break any rules? Would it have any negative implications for tax purposes or NHS pension?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[13hr shift with a fairly heavy take on acute medicine yesterday, everyone was pushing themselves to keep the flow going and shift as many to the wards as we could manage.
 We got sidetracked about 3am. A 24yo woman presented with soft tissue injuries and dislocated shoulder, with a weekly alcohol intake of 34 units. Audit-C score was 7, but CIWA-A was only 1. No symptoms of AWS. A dispute started between the F1 doing the clerking and the bay nurse, about whether she needed immediate benzodiazepine treatment to prevent withdrawal seizures.
 It escalated in a ridiculous way to include the registrar on duty, then the charge nurse, then the ward sister. Their position was that we should give the full protocol, ours was that she'd been assessed at low risk and wasn't dependent. The charge nurse started threatening 'Datix for patient safety' and trying to strongarm the F1 into prescribing.
 The argument ended when the professor in charge of the take wandered towards the noise we were making. He listened for a minute, flicked through the patient notes briefly, glanced at the numbers, then turned to the charge nurse. "My alcohol intake's higher than that, where's my benzodiazepines?" Held out his hand and started making 'gimme' gestures. No response.
 Long story short, we stopped being asked to prescribe the meds.

In the last round I was eligible for one due to a family member's medical condition, but the NHS have changed the rules meaning I no longer qualify, strangely. I found it desperately hard to find a pharmacy in Scotland who could do a private one - I just happened to be driving through near a place that did it. Otherwise I'd still be waiting. With the cost at £75 that is going to make it even harder for people to get one. I'm worried that people are going to be at risk due to location or financial situations.

 Maybe this sub always echoes negative experiences the most, but I don’t think I was wrong in saying there definitely are bottlenecks lol. 
 Didn’t like 300 qualified anaesthetics trainees fail to go into ST3 or 4 (sry i forgot the official statistic) because the government refuses to create more training places?

 I’ve emailed to see if the post could be swapped to a more Neurology-focussed post, but unfortunately apparently there aren’t any more options available at the moment - they’ve said they’ll let me know. 
 Just wondering what my options might be for this? And if it will impact on speciality applications in the future? 
 Would appreciate any advice!

SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate and evolve with important genetic and antigenic evolution of the spike protein.
The objective of an update to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition is to enhance vaccine-induced immune responses to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.
As the virus is expected to continue to evolve from JN.1, the TAG-CO-VAC advises the use of a monovalent JN.1 lineage as the antigen in future formulations of COVID-19 vaccines.
In accordance with WHO SAGE policy, vaccination programmes should continue to use any of the WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination should not be delayed in anticipation of access to vaccines with an updated composition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering throwing in the towel on medicine. Training in the UK is increasingly becoming incompatible with my life aims (yes, more so than they were before). Throughout medical school I wanted to be a psychiatrist, it was the area I was always most passionate about and genuinely exceeded at, whereas I was a very underachieving student elsewise.
 I can't help but feel a degree of resentment to those who are applying to psych despite likely having no actual specific interest in the field. This is undoubtedly selfish, but I feel like my field of passion has practically been stripped away from me, as I'm only able to work in a very specific area of the country due to family commitments. 
 I'm stuck locuming with the threat of redundancy looming over me, and honestly I'm spending half my time in a state of anxiety and uncertainty.
 I'm wondering whether it might be time to get off the medicine wagon and give myself space to breath and retrain as a Psychotherapist.
 Would this be a practical move?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I received superb, expert, compassionate and life-improving care from my local eye hospital. I suffered eye trauma in a freak accident, and thanks to your colleagues I've gone from a traumatic cataract, >60 intra-ocular pressure and other assorted grievances to successful surgery, dramatically improved vision and a low, manageable risk of glaucoma. 
 I want to thank the brilliant people who helped me, in a way that gives them the recognition they deserve from the brass! No doubt they'll have handled much more serious matters than mine, but this was a scary episode nonetheless. Their skill and compassion made me feel safe - a profoundly valuable thing at a time of vulnerability. 
 I gather that an email to PALS helps with the portfolio. What I'd like to know specifically: 
  
Will a single email about everyone suffice? I don't remember everyone's name (I was seen by a lot of people), but should be able to provide enough identifying info. 
 Will the brass read it?
 Will it be seen by the people themselves? On a personal level, I'd like them to know just how much I appreciate them.
 
 A couple of nuggets stand out: 
  
The doctor in A&E who calmed me and made me laugh when I was freaking out about my 60+ IOP, and who also had the humility to say that she had to check what to do with the glaucoma consultant. Knowing what you don't know and admitting it is surely the most noble form of intelligence. 
 The consultant herself. I suppose we expect consultants to be expert and decisive (she was both), but she was also approachable, attentive and friendly over multiple appointments. 
  
It occurs to me that bedside manner is more memorable to patients than hard-earned clinical skill. Perhaps that's just because we understand it better. Anyway, it stays with you, and I salute you all for retaining your humanity in a society that under-values you. 
 Sorry for banging on. All insights into what's best for your colleagues are welcome!

 I've noticed over the last couple of weeks I've been feeling a bit down. Struggling to be present, a little more anxious, and just not as happy.
 Only made the realisation today that a big part of it will be unfulfillment at work. On medicine I was seeing patients independently, having good relationships with seniors, and feeling like a valued member of the medical team. On surgery, the seniors haven't even bothered to learn my name, I am not using my clinical brain whatsoever, and I spend all day doing ward jobs.
 I don't want to feel like this for the next 3.5 months. I don't dread going in and when I'm in I am not having overtly bad days, but I'm just not enjoying life as much. Does anyone have any tips, inside or outside of work, for dealing with this?

 Received no induction for this post.
 Had a look at the rota when I received it 8 weeks ago, it showed I was working 8-5pm on the 1st May Bank Holiday. Nothing on the rota showed I would be specifically be working. I spoke to my fellow GP colleagues who said it would be an off day as I'm not oncall. No word from the rota coordinator regarding this either.
 Now the rota has changed to show I'm working an acute ward 8-5 on that day. I've already booked my tickets abroad and it will be expensive to change. 
 How should I approach this?

 I know things in the NHS are bleak, but wondering if anyone has any experience coming from Australia to the NHS temporarily? The proximity to europe is a big selling point.
 Not sure what stage of my career/UK training this would be possible, I’ve seen the posts around locum positions being harder to come by etc. In Australia we will now have a 2 year internship system (similar to F1/F2), and people will generally work in HMO/SRMO/unaccredited registrar jobs whilst trying to get onto training (can be many years depending on specialty).
 I know people often move internationally for fellowships, however with how long specialty training now takes in Australia, I would likely be mid to late 30s by that point and children makes things harder.

 I will be moving to the UK from Oz at the end of the year to start a Clinical Research Fellow job in London. By that point I will have GMC registration as a specialist (neurology).
 I had heard from seniors who did similar work in the UK many years ago that they supplemented their income by doing clinics on some weekends where they saw patients who are basically on a backlog waiting to be seen by specialists in a public clinic. I was wondering if this is still a thing nowadays and how feasible it is to pursue this for supplemental income and what the logistics may be to seek out this type of work?

 First time poster here so be gentle. Been doing F3 and F4 locums via an agency (will keep their name off here) and have spoken to one of my colleagues about the use of umbrella companies. He has informed me that he uses the same company and is getting full take home pay and is sorting out his taxes with his accountants. He has said he has been happy with this arrangement but has recently found out through 2 different agency staff that used to work at this company that they where actually not paying the VAT and the agency staff would take a fixed percentage of this on a weekly basis in forms of a bonus from the "umbrella company". 
 I was shocked by this and have spoken to a few agencies about this and been advised that there is only two companies that allow this practise and I am shocked and appalled by this. I've calculated it to be that some people can be making £2000 per week from their locum doctors. I have no proof other then these conversations but am I right to feel concerned and what is the best practise? I am not using the same company as my colleague so cant imagine it is being done with my pay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some may be unaware of the big issue. Basically the Inquiry is investigating 2000 mental health deaths in across NHS trusts in Essex. The Inquiry has been given legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence (but only after pressure from relatives and the Chair of the Inquiry. 
 "Dr Geraldine Strathdee [.....] had said she could not effectively do her job without those powers. She said only 30% of named staff – those essential witnesses involved in deaths she was investigating – had agreed to attend evidence sessions." Read all about it! https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/28/inquiry-mental-health-deaths-essex-nhs-trusts-given-legal-powers
 Check the Inquiry website for more details: https://lampardinquiry.org.uk/
 Nobody should be under any illusion that excess deaths among mental health patients isolated just to a patch in Essex. 
 I've been pissing in the wind and foaming at the mouth about the state of care in mental health services for the last 10 years. It is indeed deplorable that 'people have to die' before anyone takes real notice. But.. but.. that's how the Empire works. 'You' could spot the same pattern of operation in several other spheres of UK life. 
 Well in the background I have factual inside information that lawyers are queuing up to sue (somebody). Who's going down? Some from high command and some low hanging fruit. 
 Who'll be going up? Where? Why that'll be 'some doctors' to the sacrificial altar of the GMC!! What - you don't believe it? Just wait. 
 Horror stories in your patch of mental health services? Do share anonymously (no details that may identify an organisation or individual, or that are before a court or likely to be before a court). Not necessarily about deaths but what about abysmal care?

I was expecting some sort of payment in March as my tax and remaining hours were added from February. Then I got a payment in March similar to my normal pay, I have again now received the same amount, this is a continuation on their behalf of my normal pay.

 Keen on dual training in the future but I’m foxtrot oscaring to Australia at the end of F2 for a year or two. Can this time in ED count towards the “medical part” of my training? I’m lead to believe that I’m better off doing ACCS to avoid being an ST5 reg going back to be a gerries SHO. Just wondering if my ED experience in Aus will count and I can do Anaesthetic Core Training and then apply for an ICM number in ST5?

 I’ve already got plenty of tattoos but in pretty ‘safe for work’ areas - above elbows, torso etc.
 I’m into them, they make me happy and they’re cheaper than therapy post Covid ICU rotas. Outside work I’m in a hardcore music band and they’re very much part of the culture too. 
 I was thinking of getting some on my arms, and eventually even hands/neck when I find designs that are suitable. 
 Does anyone care anymore? I’ve got a training number, I kind of think ‘f*ck it’ at this point. I am aware though that this is not everyone’s opinion and there is a lot of unconscious bias around them, particularly job hunting if I’m planning to CCT and flee. 
 Ideas, concerns, expectations? Thx.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 It's your friendly neighbourhood IMG, who has never lived in London. I got offered a post in the South London Deanery, and I could use your expert opinions.
 The first thing that I am worried about is the cost of living. Will I be able to afford to live on my own in London with the salary of an ST3? Seeing that now I am almost 30 years old, I think I am ready to start making a step ahead in my life and try to get my own place. I dread the fact that I might be going into my early 30s and not being able to afford to live on my own. 
 The second thing that I would like to ask for your advice on is which areas of London would you advise me to seek a house in. My deanery is going to be in South London, but I have heard rumours that it can be quite dangerous. I have never lived in a dangerous city in the past and I would rather avoid areas with high criminal rates. Which areas would you recommend? Do you think it is a good idea to live above the river and commute every day?
 One final thing that I would like to mention is that currently I am not able to afford a car, as I have spent a fortune on my Royal College exams, courses, study material etc. Will I be able to reach the hospitals in my Deanery using public transport or is owning a car a must?
 Many thanks! xoxo

How is this allowed? With such bottle necks in training there it makes it even more ludicrous for hospitals to take these shortcuts. For all the gripes with US training at least it's on a level field once you are in residency you are guaranteed an attending job no ifs or buts and you won't be gazumped by someone from overseas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says, I’m expecting to be involved in an SI. For obvious reasons I will be very vague about the details. 
 My biggest mistake was not documenting that I escalated it to the consultant, because consultants are notoriously bad at documenting their actions thereafter so I guess on paper it looks like I was the last contact with the patient. Before I knew the final patient outcome, I told the consultant about my anxiety around the situation and they said “it’s fine, you escalated it to me, it was my responsibility”, but obviously I didn’t write that on paper and they didn’t document anything after that. 
 Fully expecting to be contacted about this case and am beyond anxious about how it will play out. 
 I’m a foundation year. Will involvement in something like this affect my future career? 
 As soon as I felt out of my depth with the symptoms, that’s when I handed it over to the consultant. Technically the symptom was escalated to me, but I didn’t know what to do so I escalated further. We all know the first month of rotation is very much finding your feet, I had no idea what to do in this specific situation, hence the further escalation as I wasn’t getting anywhere. If something goes wrong, do consultants often field the responsibility and inquests themselves or do they often bounce the blame back at the more junior doctor? 
 I’m absolutely terrified and this physical and overwhelming anxiety is enough to make me seriously question a future in this career. I don’t ever want to be involved in this stuff but it seems like perfect storms happen and I fucking hate this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an img due to CCT in less than a year, and it just keeps looking like I should either leave the UK and/or GP as a speciality.
 First off, GP is really grueling. Infact more gruelling than my previous job in ED. Most people seem to only be able to tolerate 6-7 sessions/wk. As a salaried that can be as low as 66-77k a year. As a clinical fellow in ED I was making 63k after banding. Like...what is the point in being a salaried GP? 
 Like I can genuinely make more than this, if I currently go back to work as a clinical fellow job in Wales,Scotland or NI. It would probably be easier too.
 Last week, my supervisor the other week said to me "it's true the job market is bad. It's true that you are competing with ARRs roles". So I have to work super hard for 66-77k. Pathetic. Why not just retrain in literally any speciality in Wales?
 I don't understand. I really like this country and want to work here. But why would anyone continue to work this hard in GP? Like It's feel literally crazy for me to stay in this country. 
 Please tell me I'm missing something. I must be missing something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adult nurses are so much more helpful - they won’t sigh, roll their eyes and behave like you’re asking them to move a mountain when you ask them to do a set of observations or a urine dipstick or to give a prescribed medicine to a patient. 
 Every single paediatric nurse I’ve come across in my time as a doctor (except for a handful I could count on one hand) have been nothing but entitled, rude and quite frankly unwilling to do anything asked of them unless they want to do it. Also find it bizarre most claim not to be trained in taking bloods from children and expect an F1 or any other doctor who doesn’t come across children nearly as much as them to do the bloods instead. Paediatric trainee doctors constantly have to do their own urine dipsticks and observations - can their HCA/nurses not do this? Adult nurses are also busy but they don’t go around saying “im busy I’ll try if I can get round to it” when you ask them to do the most basic thing. Also paediatric nurses when they speak to speciality teams honestly just come across as rude and entitled and quick to behave passive aggressively or straight up rude. I find the temperament of (most) adult nurses to be a lot more mature, level headed and less likely to behave like a bratty teenage girl. 
 Could someone shed light on this?

 6 months GP.
 3 months hospital rotations x2.
 6 months ITP - 2 days GP and 3 psych.
 3 months hospital x2.
 12 months GP.
 They're saying that if I do it 80% LTFT I won't meet the 12 months in hospital requirement because ITP doesn't count?! Despite it being over half the week in psych (they said I'll only get 1 day of GP if I'm part time).
 So I'll have to do an extra 3 month hospital rotation or convert ITP into 4 days psychiatry instead of 3 + 1 GP.
 Does this sound right to anyone?

 Managed to get an offer for LAT in gastro in Northern Scotland. Ranked bottom order end. 
 Im inclined to accept this as want to get into a structured program rather than spend time as trust grade or locum. I am split but generally glad tbh. 
 Questions 
 1- what are the experiences of people who have done LAT? How does this affect applications next year? Does it help? 2- Any idea where Ill be spending the year? I would hope it would be ARI rather than iverness or shetland as that would be less than ideal. 3- What is the expected salary take home for st4 as i understand the taxes are different compared to England? 4- Any comments about training and training opportunities up north? 5- Any comments about living costs and accommodation 
 Thanks in advance 
 Kind regards

I then got into core surgical training on the second attempt - this was a huge feat for me and I worked damn hard to get in. I thought I’d made it. I thought I was finally going to be a surgeon. My CST years were some of the most gruelling of my life - i sacrificed so much to progress and prepare a portfolio for St3 applications. The MRCS exams took a huge mental toll on me. I sat Part A 3 times and passed Part B the first time. Regarding MRCS, I wasn’t alone. I know a lot of my colleagues who also had multiple attempts. Since finishing core surgical training, I have applied to ST3 Trauma and Orthopaedic surgery 3 times. I have been unsuccessful each time. I thought this year was different. I had prepared very well only to be thrown under the bus in the interview. The clinical scenarios were much harder than previous years and I feel like the whole interview process was just poorly delivered. I am also disappointing my family and friends by not getting a training number so the mental toll is a lot. I am planning to give it 1 more shot next year. I guess I just came to Reddit for some motivation during a time where I feel as though all hope is lost.

 Surely, if they were extremely concerned they can send the patient to A&E where they would then be referred to the specialist if needed. Or, they should see the patient themselves and then refer appropriately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IMT3 here, funnily enough IMT breeds burnout (who'd have thought it!). But everyone around me (literally every other IMT3 I work with) is hellbent on entering training ASAP as everyone says there won't be any training numbers left soon. Everyone else is off to take ST4 numbers in August. I've taken a more chilled approach this year as it doesn't seem to be quite the mega competition of core training (yet....) and my mental health is sort of in the toilet.
 I'd love 1-2 years out to decompress, see the world, see family, be a normal non doctor human. I'm pre kids so I could have a lot of freedom and nice times. Or I could aim for ST4 next round starting training in Feb 2025 (if I'm lucky, there should be numbers in areas of country I'd like to live in).....
 Is being a consultant lots better? Should I be pushing towards consultancy soon and ending the misery of med reg night shifts and rotating? Or will I be a 35 year old consultant with a couple of kids regretting prioritising my career over a couple of fufilling years out of training?
 I'm female and expect to take a few mat leaves and then LTFT so I suspect I won't get there very fast regardless, it's whether or not I add 1-2 years extra on by taking some time to chill now vs cracking on with HST for a couple years at 100%. We see young people die at work which I think skews my view that life is short and work doesn't matter all that much.
 I'd love to hear from anyone who entered ST4 after a couple of years out, do you regret it now when you see people who were at your stage and are now consultants whilst you're still working nights? Or do you feel lucky that you had amazing experiences that you just can't have in your 40s/50s when tied down by kids and a mortgage?
 P.S. I really like my family/friends in the UK, so despite the absolutely appalling weather I don't want to CCT and flee so this would be based on life staying in the UK for the long term

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have completed core psychiatry training and have opted to take some time out of training for personal reasons and am looking to move to a speciality doctor role (potentially long term and looking for some protections e.g. sick pay, parental leave, etc., hence why I am less keen on locuming). 
 I'm struggling to find a huge amount of information about what nodal point I would come in at on the SAS payscale. Is it nodal point 4 because I have three years of psychiatry experience or is it nodal point 8 because I have over seven years of NHS service? I have also read that people have had some success in negotiating there starting point with their trust.
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll start off with fonts and styles. This may be of importance to those doctors whose work is text-intensive and where quality of presentation matters e.g. senior doctors in psychiatry and expert witness doctors. 
 In psychiatry the work is text intensive for producing reports of various kinds: Tribunal reports, Managers' reports, CPA, CTR, Court of Protection and so on. Presentancy is 'everything' (chuhknowwhuhahmean). Most 'medics' - or is that doctors - don't give a monkeys about fonts or Styles. Some don't know what's that Style ribbon at the top of MS Word is for, nor do their typists (secretaries or admins). I'm not doing a tutorial on that here. 
 What is of relevance is that for the doctors who need to format there work for 'presentancy' and readability (like me) are being told that Trusts require all correspondence to be in Arial 12pt, by policy. No such policy has been found over the last 10 years of me searching for it across 10 Trusts. I dare say it does not exist.
 But wait - I started off with one issue to illustrate something else that happens in your beloved NHS What's that?
 Loads of people make up policies as they go along. The commonest is 'good practice'. Nobody quoting anything of 'good practice' has been able to provide me with a reference to the 'good practice'. 
 The other one was "No patient gets Sectioned unless they have a CTR (care and treatment review)." No such policy exists in writing anywhere and if it exists it is legally wrong. 
 And another, "Intensive support must be consulted before a LD patient is sectioned". Doesn't exist. Can't find that anywhere (though it may well exist in a neck of the woods somewhere that I've not been). 
 I'd like to hear from those who have witnessed the same sort of making up of policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to avoid ranting. Here's my experience. 
  
was on waitlist for fy1. Found out shortly before starting where I was working. Jumped in to hospital accomodation. Had a detrimental effect on personal life being short notice. Didn't have time to sort a flat. 
 in a pretty depressing part of the country. 
 got bullied during one rotation by senior doc. Was very stressed and put my head down. Didn't get signed off. Some concerns. Overall 90% of feedback is good. Still unsure what will happen come ARCP 
 during above period, a romantic relationship fell apart. 
 I was very burned out but managed to get some sick leave with strikes which gave me a couple weeks off. 
 I have enough left in the tank to finish just about. 
 I have to move from current location. 
 I have connections in a good ed (which i like) in a nice city, apparently there is locum work there. Buts it's expensive. 
 I also have connections abroad down under. Could get a job there. 
  
-right now I'm unsure of next steps. It's pretty daunting thinking about moving. I'm just exhausted and dont trust myself.
 I just need a break now. Any kind words or words of wisdom appreciated. I'm better but still stressed. I have spoken with PH and gained some support. In counselling. any kind words appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick question that has me a bit baffled…
 I was in an elective c-section, after birth baby had poor tone and no initial respiratory effort. Anyways after resuscitation by the midwife, the buzzer was pulled as baby’s sats were still low despite inflation breaths, NG aspiration of stomach and subsequent face mask O2.
 In response to the buzzer and “paeds” being called, an ACP from paeds attended. She was great, and I learnt stuff from her when I was asking questions about management, and it seemed that everything right was done for baby.
 But an ACP? To essentially a crash call? For adults senior doctors attend. So what is going on here? The ACP seemed quite well versed in everything, but this doesn’t sit right with me. 
 There was a point where the ACP said “if things don’t improve by x time, I’m calling my reg”, but why wasn’t a paediatrician there initially? NICU is on the same floor!!! 
 I know that even paeds isn’t safe from scope creep and noctors, but can’t we get real doctors to attend to a neonatal emergency.
 Maybe this was because it hadn’t quite gotten to cardiac arrest? But initially wasn’t far off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is I was employed by the NHS from Jan 23 as I understand you get 1only get 1 month sick leave in your first year. It's now nearly may 24 my question is am I still considered in my first year of service or my second year of service? I was told that I had to complete my second year of service before I'm entitled to two months sick pay, which doesn't make sense as I'd technically be in my third year of service?
 Do I need to complete the entire year of service before I'm entitled to second year service sick leave or am I entitled to that now as I've technically worked here more than 12 consecutive months.

I'm completely naive to the rota and AL as a doctor as I'm still a final year medical student hopefully starting FY1 in August 2024. Please can you enlighten me? My 2nd rotation is a medical job in a tertiary centre in a rather niche specialty (I think it's niche anyways - endocrinology) if that adds any weighting to your advice. I also want to say thank you in advance to everyone who replies, I've posted quite a few times asking all my silly questions and have always received amazing advice and replies so tysm to you all!!

That’s enough time to do permanent nerve damage if something like B12 deficiency or other deficiencies. 
 Previous practise in countryside never posed problems like this- they emailed results promptly & booked doctor appointment at later date, but allowed you to see result before appointment. 
 This is my data- it should be law they they cannot refuse. Had this nonsense before in other practises as well. Unbelievable!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on a community placement and we often get medical students coming through. Last week we had a student join us during the morning MDT meeting and introduced herself as a medical student. We did a few cases together during the week and she seemed uninterested in anything I had to teach but was very keen to jump in and take over the patient interviews. I didn't mind her confidence but she took irrelevant histories and didn't seem to understand a lot of basics. She always tried to go out of her way to agree with the consultant and it felt like she was trying to "one up" me. It really didn't seem like normal behaviour for a medical student so figured she was just a very driven student who had yet to start her downward journey on the dunning-kruger graph.
 I found out from one of the nurses that she was a nursing student, and was told many of them introduce themselves as medical students, which we agreed was disingenuous. She later confirmed that she would be finishing nursing school soon when asked in front of our MDT.
 I'm not originally from the UK, but is it normal for nursing students to identify themselves as medical students? I was introducing her as a medical student, and now I'm feeling guilty about misleading my patients.

A few months ago I drafted a response to a bizarre patient complaint... the patient had booked an appointment under her name so her dog could get some antibiotics for a cough/chest infection. I'm not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation. Then she complained to the practice and when rebuffed, went to the NHS obusdman who shut her down too. What is wrong with people!?!?!?
 So guys, what's the funniest or bizarre complaints you've been part of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's seems every patient is complaining about the NHS, especially GPs. A few months ago I drafted a response to a bizarre patient complaint... the patient had booked an appointment under her name so her dog could get some antibiotics for a cough/chest infection. I'm not sure how it got past the receptionist. I politely advised her to consult a vet and not waste valuable NHS GP appointments in future and ended the consultation. Then she complained to the practice and when rebuffed, went to the NHS obusdman who shut her down too. What is wrong with people!?!?!?
 So guys, what's the funniest or bizarre complaints you've been part of?

 I've had two complaints so far and I'm feeling a little deflated. My trainer has said the patients were being unreasonable both times, and apart from being "more polite" there wasn't any learning to take away. She didn't even recommend writing a reflection on them, which I may do anyway but I'm not sure how to word it? Or what learning I should be taking away?
 The first one: I asked the patient to book another appointment to discuss problem #3 as I had others waiting and had started to run behind. The issue wasn't urgent - I quickly checked red flags and then booked him in for 2 days later. He called later that day, angry that he had to come back in. I thought I'd been pretty polite about it, explained that I needed to take a full history and do another examina…]]></summary>

I wasn’t formally admitted I don’t think by which I mean I didn’t see a doctor, get a bed or like a wristband. I spoke to a nurse on the floor of the waiting room I was in about not wanting to stay any longer than I already had, who told me I could sign some self-discharge papers, which I did. Today my final discharge papers from there have come in where it says “patient walked out” under diagnosis. That sounds like I just up and walked out without saying anything to anyone but I’m no healthcare professional so I’m not sure if that’s okay. I wanted to ask if anyone knows if that’s all okay and adds up, and if it’s likely to cause any issues now or in the future? Thanks!!
 I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this so if not I’m sorry

 When applying they asked where I have worked, to which I answered the city hospital I have spent the last 3 years. 
 They have put me in the DGH ~30miles away. I am due to continue working in my current hospital and am not due to go this DGH, or any other nearby, at all during core training. However, it does fall under my deanery.
 I had thought you couldnt have PACES in your home deanery, but am now realising I can't find anything online to that effect.
 Have I lucked out, or has the royal college made an error?

 European medical schools have the last year as part of your medical school - well you do work but unless apply to leave and work elsewhere you work locally in a hospital.
 please can someone who knows the historic background explain why this was changed in UK?
 and wouldn't it be better if everyone had the first option to stay locally (guaranteed in their deanery) with those who have good reasons to leave apply to leave? rather than this lottery mess?
 and if we thought this was better, how can we as seniors petition for this / support this to happen?

 I was hoping to get some advice about what I could be doing during my gap year before f1.
 ​
 I’ve been allocated this year to a region that is well away from my support network and would not be good for my mental wellbeing to start working this year whilst feeling isolated.
 ​
 Although there is no guarantee this won’t happen again next year, I am considering taking a year out.
 ​
 Has anyone taken a gap year before F1? Any suggestions on what would be useful to do for speciality applications moving forward?

 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was an international student that graduated from a UK medical school in 2020 and completed FY1. Due to issues at home I had to leave the UK and foundation programme post FY1 to be at home and have been working in my home country as an SHO grade doctor since in Internal Medicine (staying until the end of FY2 was not really a viable option at the time). 
 When I had left post FY1, my foundation school was under the impression that if I were to consider coming back, this would be via a standalone F2 post or CREST form - which I have been made aware in the last few years that CREST is only open to doctors who have never been in the foundation program. 
 Was wondering if anyone has advice on available routes back to the UK, as well as if I were to attempt to return - if it would have to be back at F2 level or if I would be able to apply for training later on should I plan to complete further qualifications eg MRCP exams. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 So, I work on an elderly care discharge ward, where people are supposed to be MOFD. But spending months waiting for social issues to sort out, they keep getting new medical issues.
 Plus, there are chronic medical issues that families want taken care of, while they are in the hospital, as an opportunistic bonus.
 Now, its basically just me and a PA (nice but relatively new). Before, it was me and another SHO and we used to divide patients evenly.
 We're being told to prioritize TTOs rather than clinical reviews because pharmacy can't process orders (dosette boxes) in time if we do them after noon
 The issue at hand is that i usually need time to look at a patient my own way, and write in my own style. I'm a bit conscious of making sure that I'm not missing any key details when reviewing a patient, or that any TTO I write is well written.
 Also, the ward manager is insisting that instead of breaking up patients, we divide tasks instead. Things like "Oh, the PA can write the discharge summary and you can prescribe....."
 The PA is a nice lady and she can take bloods decent enough...(somewhat)
 The problem is, I can't review patients late (all the investigation results and imaging gets delayed), and I seriously hate prescribing meds (Especially CDs) when the written portion is a missing key details (like why a drug was discontinued or whether a resus status was changed)
 I take pride in my work, and want to do it in its entirety.
 Does anyone how to handle this kinda workload?
 It's gotten so bad that normally, an MOFD patient is supposed to be reviewed every week just to see if they're ok, and no one's reviewing them for 2-3 weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to work out whether I need to be asking my F1 and F2 trusts for a pension rebate because I worked additional hours as a locum from which pension was taken off. 
 Struggling to find information on whether pay above full time hours / locum pay while being on a substantive contract is pensionable. 
 BMA seems to suggest all pay should be included " Accrual in the 2015 scheme is based on each year’s actual earnings and service and whole time pay is not relevant. From 1 October 2022 Officer pension contribution tiers in England and Wales are linked to actual pensionable pay and not the notional full time equivalent rate."
 NHSBA seems to suggest differently "Overtime, in relation to the NHS Pension Scheme, is hours worked in excess of the whole time standard working week. Therefore a part timer’s pensionable pay must include any additional hours worked up to the whole time working week, and hours worked over the whole time working week are not pensionable. For example, if the standard working week is 37.5 hours, a part timer normally working 20 hours a week may pay pension contributions on up to 17.5 additional hours per week."
 But then also this from NHSBA? "The payroll solution must use the previous scheme years actual pensionable earnings to set the member contribution rate (instead of using whole-time equivalent earnings). If the member did not work a full year the actual earnings should be annualised."
 ​
 What's right? I'm sure I'm just not reading it all correctly tbh.
 Is the best thing to do just to ask payroll?

 While I am excited, I'm starting to get really nervous. I'll be at a hospital I've never been at before, I don't know anyone else who will be working at that hospital. I know this is the same for most people, but I am really worried I won't find anyone to go through the tough stuff with - I feel like it's taken me all the years of medical school to finally find a group of people I'm at least semi-comfortable with. I feel like I'm just chronically misunderstood by peers and I am just worried about how everything will all go. 
 I've already spoken to OH, they have mentioned something about a WRAP form but other than that I don't even know what can be done to help someone who's autistic in a ward setting. 
 I guess I'm just starting to panic a bit. I suppose I'm looking for reassurance that foundation is doable, and maybe some tips if anyone has any. 
 Thank you 🙏

I can’t imagine myself in any specialty other than histopath and I am quite set on it but the insane competition ratio is quite disheartening and I feel even with a QIP in pathology, a first author publication (non histopath but is related to another medical specialty) and some teaching experience (delivered occasional teaching here and there but planning on histopath specific ones aimed at FYs) and tasters, I won’t even make it to the interview. So to maximise the points, I was looking at events hosted by RcPath but they seem to be aimed at consultant level doctors rather than suitable for absolute novices like myself. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Do haematology events count (from what I know this is a group 2 medical specialty rather than a pathology specialty so was unsure whether there was any point)?
 Any tips?

 I'm a GP by background (CCTed a few years ago), and have worked in a non clinical public health related job for the past year. I've got an interest in sexual health with a couple of previous GUM jobs during training and have done the DFSRH. A little out of date with it all now, but really enjoyed previous work in this area. 
 I'd really appreciate advice from anyone who has made the switch to a specialty (non-training grade) doctor in sexual health, either full-time or alongside GP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advice on getting an SAS / specialty doctor post in sexual health / GUM.
 I'm a GP by background (CCTed a few years ago), and have worked in a non clinical public health related job for the past year. I've got an interest in sexual health with a couple of previous GUM jobs during training and have done the DFSRH. A little out of date with it all now, but really enjoyed previous work in this area. 
 I'd really appreciate advice from anyone who works as a specialty (non-training grade) doctor in sexual health. Particularly interested in how you ended up in this role, what level of experience is needed, and how I can improve my chances of getting a post. 
 If anyone is willing to have a chat or offer some advice on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!

 Surely there’s a slicker, GDPR-compliant, NHS Trust-friendly of going about this? What do you guys use?

 Got a Neurosurgery JCF job interview coming up. I'm quite excited about it since I've enjoyed previous surgically-minded jobs, and have been reading up common emergencies that I might deal with eg post op hyponatremia.
 Problem is when I try to look at troubleshooting ventricular drains, most guidelines essentially say "call neurosurgery" or to replace the drain.
 I'm curious if anyone might share their insights into a JCF's approach to common issues. What might I be phoned about from the wards, and what would they expect me to try in the first instance before escalating to SpR?
 Thank you for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was doing a clinic today with my consultant & there was an assistant with us helping and coordinating the patients. One of the patients was grateful and very emotional and brought us biscuits as a gesture. When the patient left the clinic, the assistant immediately picked the 3£ gift and went: “Are we even allowed to accept that? I’ll put it in the staff room and you can help yourselves if you want you”
 I mean FFS !!!! Our assistants are so brainwashed from the ridiculously demeaning position of NHS doctors that they would not even have the courtesy to ask permission from the consultant, who the gift is presumably for and who is also in charge of their own clinic, before taking the gift away.
 I did a good job for my patient, my patient expressed their gratefulness by gifting a 3£ biscuit, I felt rewarded that they are grateful- but no, the NHS culture would make sure to remind us that we do not even deserve this gesture.
 I am so fed up with the recurrent manifestations of this upside down hierarchy at the NHS where everyone think, act and actually are the bosses except doctors. I think this culture towards doctors at the NHS is so bad that I doubt reversing it would happen in my lifetime and I would rather run away than spending my career devalued.
 Rant over
 Edit: typos

I normally do really well with osces etc however I feel like doing the daily reviews etc, I’m struggling to come up with my own plans and just forgetting stupid stuff- such as day 2 post-op with (in hindsight) very obvious pneumonia/Lrti presentation. In an examination it just comes naturally to say things like XR etc but on the wards I just feel like I’m forgetting really stupid stuff and the management plans I know I can do just aren’t translating in to practice?
 Wondering if anyone has any advice thank u!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm peripherally involved in simulation training at my local medical school. The simulator is pretty simple: a mannequin, a monitor, some dummy drugs to be drawn up or checked, some blood gas print outs and people pretending to be nurses, registrars etc. The trainees are final year medical students, FY1s and FY2s. The simulated scenarios are vanilla adult medical and surgical emergencies in which the trainee is called to the ward for a patient that's "gone off".
 The scenarios themselves seem pretty realistic and I try to make the debriefings as educational as possible using the After Action Review model, but it seems the trainees get no particular preparation on emergencies before the simulation day and there's no follow up afterwards on lessons identified. It's just one or two simulator days a year in isolation. I've discussed this with the faculty who run the simulator but their view is that preparation and follow up are Someone Else's Problem.
 Has anyone had better experience of sim training than this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys-I'm back with another MRCP part 2 exam question. I think cardiology is really screwing me over....I'd appreciate any advice. Thank you in advance. 
 A 45 year old is admitted with palpitations following excess alcohol consumption at a wedding. His BP is 90/50 and his HR is 130 bpm and regular. 
 Bloods were all normal. 
 ECG:

 https://preview.redd.it/bem4y970fgwc1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=faf881537e2f7eb1ebe14df8a66049b28581e976
 What is the most appropriate intervention?
 Amiodarone
 Digoxin
 DC Cardioversion
 Metoprolol 
 Verapamil 
 ​
 I thought that since he's haemodynamically unstable we would go for DC cardioversion however the answer is amiodarone. They stated that since the patient has a junctional tachycardia the treatment of choice is either IV amiodarone or IV flecainide. 
 I had a read about junctional tachycardia vs SVT. 
 So junctional tachycardia is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR >100. SVT is abnormal/absent P waves with a HR >150. 
 I've been trying to find a good paper to explain the management of junctional tachycardias because it sounds a bit different compared with SVT but I can't find anything. One paediatric paper said that we can give amiodarone, another said phenytoin. And wikipedia has actually been the most helpful and said that we don't normally do DC cardioversion in junctional tachycardia. 
 Is anyone able to shed some light on the management of junctional tachycardia and how it differs to SVT?

 I just wanted to check, are these two separate things? The surgery sounded like my summary care record could take a while but I am wondering if getting the app access will be faster and if I should ask for that instead/as well. I don’t want to clog up my surgery with requests but I wanted to get the information asap as I think there might be some things I need to address and it seems like granting app access should be straightforward?

 I would like to submit our work to a conference as a poster. I don't need my colleague's help for creating the abstract or the poster itself. Does their name still need to go on the poster as they were involved in the work that happened prior? My suspicion is probably it does but I thought I would just check! Thanks.

 Does anyone know why we don't just say 1mg/ml or 0.1mg/ml? 
 It just seems odd that we do it that way for such an important drug and often you get passed the wrong thing at arrests and such. And you end up back calculating in your brain for infusions. 
 I don't ask for '1 in 100' propofol' or '1 in 200' bupivacaine. 
 Is there some historical reason?
 Why stop there with the slightly confusing descriptions? Why not ask for one 60th of a grain of adrenaline from the apothecary? Is it just me who finds this more confusing than it should be?
 So many questions.

 The joys of rotational training and service provision have meant I will be placed in a hospital 70 miles away (1:40hr travel each way).
 My TPD is not very reasonable and quite mean as I had found someone to swap with but she would not let us swap. 
 I am thinking to ask for 80% LTFT to reduce the travel burden but am worried this will get rejected as other than making my life easier and being closer to family for longer I don’t have a super concrete reason.
 Is it worth asking or should I just suck it up for 6 months?

 I did an anaesthetics taster this time last year at the end of FY1. Enjoyed it a lot and applied but didn’t get in due to MSRA. Hadn’t done any anaesthetics placements before that. Now have done an FY2 ED job and loved that too, so between the two.
 Worried about basing an entire career on a four day taster and not sure how I feel about it now which is why I wouldn’t mind doing it again but unsure if it’ll be approved.

 I have started to use my right hand for most things because it feels more instinctive- but I suppose the handedness of the instruments (as all have been designed for right handed users) forced me to start using my right hand.
 Using my right hand feels awkward. Using my left hand feels awkward and painful (physically hurts to open the needle holder…. And lost instruments, with the L hand)
 How did lefties manage? Are there any resources? I haven’t found much online or on YouTube. Anything will be appreciated (:

 Apart from being fed up with the illness and life in general (maybe it's worse due to the nature of the illness), I am also worried about being unemployed.

I do enjoy my work and my speciality but I am completely burnt out from attempting exams and building portfolio and cannot see a future for myself when I am off sick for this long. 
 I have had 4 years of NHS service and should be eligible for 5 months of full pay. Despite explaining all these, payroll has deducted my salary and paid me peanuts. I understand that I have to chase it up and involve BMA but I have no fight left in me to deal with this.
 I did speak to my ES about all these who listened to my concerns but did nit offer much advice. I have had private counselling in the past but I cannot afford this anymore. I am completely overwhelmed and I would really appreciate if any one has any suggestions or just some kind words.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After speaking to a couple of colleagues, it seems to be a consensus that it feels like service provision only.
 Teaching is a tick the box thing and most of the time uses archaic methods. There is no official allocated person and it relies on good will. They just throw a lot of information at you to cover the curriculum.
 The workplaces highly rely on you. Therefore, there is almost no time to thing through.
 Everything feels a tick exercise: presentations, supervisor meetings , portfolio.
 Plus: they bribe you with a teaching feedback if you teach medical students who pay expense yearly fees and were supposed to have allocated preceptors and etc.
 Does anyone have different views?
 Any hope things might change ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are some of the weirdest conducts of colleagues that went unnoticed? 3 years in the NHS and I've seen some weird stuff. But some conduct cases always baffle me. Worked with an F1 who was least interested. Was alcoholic. Came late to work almost every day. Was a threat to patient care. Never really got caught in any tribunal or conduct cases somehow. Was made to re do the F1. Still has remained the same. But somehow finished F1 and now going to complete F2. Another doctor who shouted at another doctor on one incident was removed from training and referred to GMC (not saying it was right). Just weird how some blatant cases go without any major consequence, while others which we feel isn't extreme is taken to GMC.

The guidelines aren't quite clear, they say "Trainees who are deemed to be out of programme (OOP) will not be eligible to claim relocation, temporary accommodation or excess mileage payments whilst they are out of programme but may claim expenses in order to support them returning to their training programme." Obviously am out of programme now, but won't be once the training programme has started and so at the time I'd be claiming?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last installment of the Cass Review into care for gender questioning and transgender young people has been published this week, as I'm sure people have seen in the news. The big changes are the stopping of prescribing puberty blockers except through a clinical trial and a general shift in attitude away from an affirmative and medical pathway for gender transition towards exploratory psychological counselling. It's been praised by both political parties, but criticised by trans groups and international organisations.
 Apart from the merits of these changes, does anyone know why this took the form of an independent service review rather than a national guideline by NICE/ RCPCH/ RCPsych or if there are plans to produce one in the future. As far as I can work out the old GIDS service was working off the The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines which have now been declared unacceptable by Dr Cass. Has there ever been a UK guideline produced in this area?

 We need to go private and take the trainees with us. Design the private curriculum to be of a higher standard than the NHS. Take a page out of USA/Australia curriculums. 
 Various stages of fleeing might be an option for some, rest of us have to make do. Private healthcare, for patients AND doctors, is the only option.

The study, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), shows that immunization is the single greatest contribution of any health intervention to ensuring babies not only see their first birthdays but continue leading healthy lives into adulthood. 
Of the vaccines included in the study, the measles vaccination had the most significant impact on reducing infant mortality, accounting for 60% of the lives saved due to immunization. This vaccine will likely remain the top contributor to preventing deaths in…]]></summary>

 The rise in foundation doctors not getting a training number, previous F3,4,5s etc, and IMGs will saturate the market to the extent that there will be very few locum opportunities, and the rate for locum SHOs will continue to fall. 
 Unemployment 
 Eventually the market becomes that saturated that essentially as an SHO who has just finished F2. You don’t have enough experience to secure a training number, and there are no locum opportunities. So what do you do? You’re essentially unemployed from a medical point of view. No fellowships, no trust grade jobs. All over subscribed. 
 I give it 2-3 years before doctors unemployed in hundreds if not thousands. What can be done? I’m not sure if I’m being honest. I hope the BMA has plans, because honestly this is a much bigger issue than FPR. Actually in effect FPR probably further drives this issue as better pay means less people leave, and it’s more attractive to IMGs that will further up the competition for training numbers and saturate the locum market. (I’m still pro-FPR obviously just looking at it from a different angle 🦀). 
 What do people think the answer is?
 All specialities have points in their self scoring for home grad preference? Massive increase in training numbers highly unlikely to happen. Increased number of trust grade jobs? 
 I really don’t know.

This is horrific as it isnt the truth at all, i live at the end of the street to the surgery and am indeed in the catchment area on looking into it further. My question is can they just do this and make up a random reason? As after tomorrow i have no GP. It has got my head all over.

 A lot of the issue were raised regarding PA in primary care setting. Now that the government doesn't want GP to issue fit note, why can't this go to PAs instead? Extending fit note is such a tiring task on top of everything else. 
 What about going through clinic letters etc? Sure they can't prescribe, but with their existing knowledge surely they can help aid us?
 Why can't they discuss simple blood test results like Folate deficiency, or MSU that is positive in symptomatic patients on resistant empirical abx - - - which they can run through red flags of sepsis as per set protocol? 
 I really think there's a place for PA to help us in primary care, and I really think we shouldn't be so harsh on them. I'm sure a lot of them feel attacked, lied to, hopeless and I'm sure their mental health are severely affected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is more of a rant than a post, but does anyone else feel overwhelmed and just confused with emails of the pre-employment checks for GP training (or any other training post)? I'm due to start GP ST1 in August 24 and in the last two weeks have been sent over 10 emails with various links and various forms to fill in. I am grateful for the job and I feel like I shouldn't complain about this but I'm just lost in a sea of HR words and documents and waffle!
 As a little summary of the things I've been sent:
 - A welcome letter, a privacy guide to sign, a guide about how to use the 'TIS' system, had to make an account on the TIS system, then complete Form A/B of Form R on the TIS system, and a joining form, and remember to change my revalidation body on GMC website to my new education trust but only 7 days before I start the new job not earlier than that, and register with RCGP but only once I've done form R so then they can give me a training number which I then need to use on the RCGP application but it must only be for a training post, make sure I'm on the GP performers list, do a pre-health declaration form where I also need to find a life time history of my vaccinations, register for a TRAC account, sort out DBS etc etc etc ........... sigh 
 Each individual form takes me ages to fill in aswell because of poorly worded questions or tasks where I need to dig out previous evidence etc. 
 Does anyone else feel this way?

 I've attended a private clinic today for a consultation, which was initially for an umbilicoplasty, but the surgeon diagnosed it as an umbilical hernia. He's told me it's not particularly serious in itself, but there is a risk of complications developing in the future.
 The quote from the private clinic is £5000. I have already £1600 saved which was the quoted price of the umbilicoplasty, so to go ahead with this treatment would require me to find £3400 from somewhere.
 My employer doesn't currently provide private health insurance, so if I took out a policy myself, I don't know if this would cover it.
 I have searched for information regarding treating this on the NHS, but from what I can see unless there are actual symptons, this isn't available - can anyone advise?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most doctors work hand in hand with drug companies, so prefer to issue prescriptions. There seems to be a culture where by medical professionals are not allowed to express evidence led views which go against drug companies. 
 Example 1: 
 Bunion Repair
 Bunion repair by Bianchi, Italy or Harley Street = No screw, 5 minute procedure, brilliant. No pharma company involved.
 Whilst Bianchi is a superior reoair, standard NHS bunion repair = Invasive procedure using a purchased medical device (screw).
 Example 2:
 Inguinal hernia repair
 Desarda technique = A strip of external oblique is stitched to inguinal ligaments and internal oblique. Wonderful natural muscle graft. 
 Whilst desarda is superior, NHS repair = A piece of purchased polypropylene stitched into your abdominal wall. YUCK
 Example 3
 Heart stents = Research shows that the vast majority of operations brought no benefit in stable patients. But the surgeries were arguable performed due to the stents being a medical product was being pushed and purchased. 
 Example 4
 Fasting. 
 The health benefits are endless. Reverse insulin resistance, autophagy etc etc
 Fasting doesn’t involve any prescriptions, so doesn’t seem to be recommended.
 How many GP’s/consultants prescribe a 10 day fast?
 
 I can go private and see doctors with views that differ from the masses. But are there NHS doctors out there that are able to have less than conventional views without being scalded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very quick question. I’ve got Hashimoto’s disease and been under endocrine for 2 years. I was taken off Levo early on being under the team. Discharged in Jan being told my thyroid is fine. I’m declining fast so out of curiosity asked for all my results from 2022 onwards. Had them sent to me noticed only my TSH was reported. 
 I went to my GP to ask for my thyroid panel to be done and she also cannot see any bloods for T4, T3 etc. Only TSH. She was really confused. 
 I’ve been fuming thinking this hasn’t been requested in two years but found a photo of two blood forms I had for 2023 all requesting full thyroid panel. In one of the matching dates to results even my TSH is missing…
 Can labs just not be done?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys! I hope you can shine some light on my dilemma. 
 I have recently been accepted for an MBA in a top business school with a 50% scholarship - which is still a big investment. For some context, I am an IMG doctor and I co-founded a startup in London after my foundation training which went well but never took off. Last year I decided that it was time to do something different and I applied for the MBA and took a Clinical Fellow post. During my Clinical fellow post (part-time) I rediscovered my passion for medicine and how nice it is to directly help people and I managed to get an IMT spot in the reserve list in an ok location. The MBA would give me a higher salary on a corporate job but it would take me away from medicine and I am not sure I am ready for it! I am thinking about declining or at least trying to defer the MBA offer to next year and do 1 year of IMT to see how I feel. Everyone that I spoke with told me that I would regret my choice and that I am romanticising medicine as I haven't been full-time in a long time. 
 I want to hear your opinion on that, especially from doctors and consultants who like what they do. Is it that bad? What about when you become a consultant? Am I making the wrong decision?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, I could not have expected this when I started off as a medical student nor at any time after I entered the Specialist Register. 
 Today I went to see one of my male in-patients on the psychiatric ward. He was previously informed that I would be seeing him at a certain time. I was then told that he was busy masturbating. I asked someone to ask him to clean up as I'll be there in a few minutes, me thinking he'd be done by then. Minutes pass. I get to outside his room (door closed). Staff tell me "He's still at it." So I waited about 10 minutes outside of his room. Someone said I should knock and enter. I did not. I spoke with staff outside of his room for the 10 minutes. Then I had to depart for a meeting as I was now running late. He then opened the door to his room as I was about to depart and seemed to want to talk. I couldn't as I was going to be late for the important meeting. I thought there was a funny side but off course said nothing of the sort. I breached no standard of practice as far as I am aware. 
 I am unable to reveal other details - and don't ask why. I don't know how staff knew he was still at it. 
 When one meets an unexpected first, one obviously wonders about what one would do if the situation presented itself again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seems like a lot of people on this subreddit are very pro-CCT and flee, but was curious if most people expressing these views are ST4+? 
 Currently an ST1 and training's been alright - it's shielded from a lot of NHS bullshit, but you're still working for the NHS. 
 Ophthalmology is switching to a new curriculum next year, but I'm skeptical this will significantly reduce training length. At the moment, I'm anticipating to CCT in probably 7-8 years after all of ST and ?fellowship assuming I stay 100% and pass all my exams/expected competencies in a reasonable time frame. 
 I know people have talked about going to Australia or the Middle East, but frankly I'm not that keen on the latter, and if everyone's thinking of going to Australia or Canada after CCT-ing - what is the landscape even going to look like for me when I flee 8 years down the line? 😅 I do predict there will be healthcare shortages, but I would think locally, they'd also be looking to expand medical school/training places to accommodate in the next decade too. Is the prospect of CCT and flee as an ST1 even realistic?
 Also, I know ophthalmology is one of the more lucrative specialties, so surely there must be some barriers in place to emigrating vs a specialty that has a more supportive role (e.g. rads, anaes).

 Just wondering if there any rules proving this is a breach of our contract? Quite a few of my annual leave days have been/will be rejected because of this and its making it very difficult to plan time off/holidays to meet my friends :((

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to lack of capacity (mental capacity act), information on this is in the area of mental illness very vague.
 I fully understand what lack of capacity is and common conditions involve brain injury, learning disabilities, dementia etc. I understand it involves a persons ability to make decisions, remember information long enough to make a decision, communicate their decision, and so on.
 But I’m specifically asking about mental health conditions and when and how they affect a persons capacity.
 I can’t seem to find any information online, except Schizophrenia and Bipolar commonly can affect a persons capacity.
 Can someone explain how certain mental health conditions can affect a persons capacity and deem them as having lack of capacity, not just conditions mentioned above.
 For example, I understand that when someone suffering severe Anorexia is at severe risk of harm they can be deemed as lacking mental capacity.
 But when does lack of mental health capacity apply to other mental illnesses, and what factors determine this? Like can someone suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder be such a risk that they would be deemed as lacking mental capacity, and if so, what behaviours would lead to this decision?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question regarding rota - I’m not a BMA member and my local junior doctor bma rep couldn’t help. I’m working 8-6 Thursday and Friday, 8-8:30 Saturday, 8-8 Sunday, bank holiday Monday, then 8-6 Tuesday - Friday. Does the bank holiday count as splitting up the shifts and therefore no zero day is needed? I have this on a couple of other occasions (working Thursday through to the following Friday, but without the bank holiday) and after raising this (for a few months), I’ve been given the Monday as a zero day to break up the 9-day stretch. However they are refusing to give a zero day on the week with a bank holiday. They also state because I moved the working weekend I’m not owed a zero day (I moved the weekend before they agreed to give me any zero days at all, so I’d argue if I cancel my swap I need my zero day, then reinstate the swap). Note, the working pattern given above is the original rotation (as if the weekend had not been swapped). Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.
 Also, do the swaps also have to comply with rotation rules? Because I had no zero day to swap, where I’ve swapped my weekend to is now a 9-day stretch instead.

 I received a job offer for CT1/2 non training role in one of the hospitals so far away from where I live. The job is excellent and will help me boost my portfolio, and perhaps I could use it to apply for ST3 plastics surgery. 
 I am not able to afford the cost of finding a new place (paying deposit and rent) as well as paying for my current rent as my contract is due to end in June. I have asked if the trust could help with the relocation and they said that unless you are post covers more three years or so, the trust won’t be able to support you with the relocation.
 I am expected to start as soon as possible and have already signed my contract.
 I asked them if they could advise me on what to do and have only received details of the real estate agents around the area. 
 I have also asked if I could postpone my start date and haven’t received any response yet
 I am worried that they will withdraw the offer 
 Would appreciate your input/ any suggestions regarding this

I didn't have to see them this time as one of the other doctors offered to see them. However quite a few times I am the only available senior in the night shift.

Nurses start as Band 5, physician associates start as Band 7 which makes them to currently earn more than FY doctors and some CT doctors. 
 I learnt that doctors chose not to be part of the AFC and chose a different pay structure. This made FY doctors' salary to be actually at Band 5 level where as If doctors were part of AFC they would have been placed to start atleast as Band 8A. So why are starting with a band 5 salary? 
 Is it better to go back to the AFC like other staff? Is the different pay structure wee are using now going to benefit us anytime soon? ( would things fall back in place soon) 
 I am actually confused.

 Presuming the consultant doesn't reply to me in time, is it appropriate for me to submit the abstract at the last moment without their permission? 
 I don't know if I'm over thinking it, but this is likely my last and only opportunity to present this QIP to make it count for specialty applications.
 Thank you so much in advance for your advice!!

The big 3 that get mentioned are Unison, Unite and GMB but the thing that's making me hesitate about them is that Unison & Unite seem to list every other hospital profession under the sun specificaly as staff they cater to but ward clerks are lumped into the 'and other admin staff' category; and GMB seems to be workers in general with no specialisation. On one hand I get it, ward clerks are comparatively low in numbers compared to most other hospital roles, but on the other hand I want to know that a union will be looking out for us just as much as they do for the roles with big numbers.
 Open to any advice on which union might be best for ward clerks and if there's any other unions to suggest please do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I was in a diagnostic session with the consultant psychiatrist in my local NHS recovery team. My GP referred me to them for a PTSD diagnosis, CPA, talking therapies, and medication advice.
 I was taken aback during the latest session when the psychiatrist began really pushing me to look at going privately for talking therapies.
 I get that the NHS is crumbling - I work in the same NHS Trust - but it felt really wrong to me that an NHS professional should advocate for going against the founding principles of the NHS.
 Does anyone else feel that this is unethical?
 —
 Extra information: I have the distinct impression that the recovery service really doesn’t want to take me on because I need significant reasonable adjustments to their usual ways of working. My autism and ADHD impact my presentation of mental health symptoms, and I need lots of additional time to process emotions and information. The local IAPT straight up rejected me as ‘too complex,’ and told my GP to send me to recovery. But it feels that rather than adapt and adjust, recovery want to find any reason to reject me too.

 Longtime lurker posting on a throwaway. 
 I'm an SHO grade doc working in Scotland just now. I was looking at ways to bolster my income and fell onto ear syringing. I have good experience in performing it, albeit not having attended any formal courses, and feel it's relatively low risk as I intent to take a good history and ensure I'm not suctioning at a steatoma with my otoscope. A local dental practice I'm on good terms with (not my own dentist) have offered a chair a day a week to run a mini clinic. 
 Has anyone got experience in this market? I've been having difficulty finding any real info on indemnity around this. Most of the indemnity products I've found are aimed at companies/clinics with multiple practitioners. Further, does anyone know the situation with making the clinic compliant? I've read about needing CQC approval down south, but again, can't find any info on Scotland. 
 Any input is welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently a CT1 in surgery and I’m four years into medicine. I’ve done nights regularly for three of the four years. I’m still disablingly scared of them, even if I’m actually OK on the actual stretch. My current job has quite a few nights but workload is generally okay, so my anxiety is not bad but it’s certainly problematic. I find myself trawling the ED track board for hours before my shift predicting who I might have to see or not. Advice is never too far away but I am so scared of appearing shit that I prepare and over prepare. There really is no point trying to predict referrals as I know what to do with most of them anyway, but it’s a compulsion I can’t stop. 
 My next rotation will be in a speciality I have little knowledge on, but I will be covering wards AND referrals overnight. I’m scared I’m going to perpetually be a wreck. I sometimes get fleeting thoughts of calling in sick so I don’t have to deal with it - I never, ever do, but it’s so tempting sometimes that I’m ashamed to say that sometimes the thought lingers a bit too long in my head. 
 It doesn’t help that my sleep is almost universally shit on them, and my eating isn’t much better. 
 Grateful for any help/tips/reassurance that this can pass, and I can trust myself a bit more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thought I’d ask the hive mind! I’m applying for anaesthetic core training next year and would ideally like to be placed in either Oxford or Wales deanery. That said, I really want the Oxford University Hospitals rotation. I am just wondering how it all works. Am I able to apply to both and see which rotation I get before accepting my offer? Or is it deaneries first and then you choose your rotation and get allocated according to rank like the FY programme? I would take virtually anywhere in Wales tbh but if I knew for sure I’d been allocated OUH’s rotation in Thames Valley, I’d take that instead. Appreciate that this is all hypothetical and at the end of the day I’d take any post I get regardless but just wondering how it works. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yet another incoming FY1 here. Basically I have a 2 year gap between graduating and starting F1 in which I did nothing medicine-related. I feel like I've forgotten everything, both clinical knowledgewise and also everything we were told about what an FY1 is expected do. I know two years isn't that long in the grand scheme of things, but med school is an absolute blur for me. I was a mentally ill mess of a student, the counselling office was my second home, and it shocked both me and the med school staff when I somehow passed finals resits. Without saying too much, I nearly dropped out several times and was nearly too far gone. I don't remember 3 out of 4 placements from 5th year at all.
 Anyway. After a much-needed 2 year break, I am much more stable now and ready to return, but I could really do with some advice re getting back into it. I passed the UKFPO's (albeit straightforward) clinical assessment for people with a 2+ year break with a very reassuring mark, and I've been doing passmed to try and get back up to speed. I've also been reading FY1 guides and resources and I've contacted my assigned foundation deanery about possible extended shadowing. Is there anything else I should be doing? 
 Just for a little more info: I’m starting on gen surg. Also I'm hoping to apply for Anaesthetics in the future and bagged an anaesthetics FY1 rotation which I'm honestly so buzzing about. At the moment I'm working a 9-5 office job which I'm looking to quit at some point in June to give myself at least a month off + time to get my brain in gear. 
 Any recommendations re what to do between now and August would be much appreciated. I was a terrible medical student, but I want to be the best FY1 I can possibly be. I'm ready to put my best foot forward and I’m honestly quite excited, as silly as that might sound. Thank you so much🙏

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, incoming fy1 here interested in physics, maths and engineering related specialties. What sort of pathway could I go down to explore these topics more in medicine? I understand radiology has a decent amount of physics and there’s certain specialties like nuclear medicine to consider, both of which interest me a lot. I am just wondering what other things I could be doing alongside going into these specialties that could get me into a field that has a decent balance of medicine and physics/engineering. I have considered PhD programs to do with biomedical engineering that might lend to a more academic career, or ones that I could do alongside my radiology training, would like to know more about this.
 Would love to know if anyone here has gone down such a route or if anyone knows anything about it. Thank you.

From what I have seen so far from tasters in both specialties, AI is nowhere near even replacing doctors in rads or path and the clinical context is super important when producing reports of either CT scans or reporting microscopic slides which I don’t see AI deal with the nuances of anytime soon. I get asked this question so much that I feel it probably may even end up being an interview question when I make my application. But at the same time because I get asked this question a lot (by other doctors), perhaps there is some truth to it?
 What do the radiologists and pathologists here have to say about this? Interested in hearing your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I am not a consultant/GP, have been qualified and working as a doctor for 7 years. Will be keeping this vague for identifiability purposes.
 A friend of mine runs a food and drink business. They're expanding to several other countries after some success in the UK, including the USA, Europe, and Asia.
 One of the regulatory bodies has different allergen standards (I.e. acceptable concentrations), which has highlighted some issues and changes they'll have to make to sell some of their food there.
 They're looking for a doctor to essentially take the info regarding some of these issues, collate some evidence around them, and sort of explain it all to the board of their company, and attempt to quantify some risks for them. Not to necessarily say "this is medically fine" or "go full steam ahead with production", but more to explain some of the issues from a medical standpoint and the repercussions should something go wrong.
 Any risk would theoretically be covered by their indemnity and lawyers, and a document would be prepared stating that they've consulted a doctor for advice but that the company is entirely responsible and culpable for their own decisions
 My questions boil down to is this an acceptable thing to do? 
 I'm not an expert in any regard, and I'm still a junior doctor. They're asking because we are friends is all.
 Is there anyone out there who's done something similar for a company/in a commercial setting? Would it be bonkers to consider doing this (essentially it boils down to a literature review turned to lay language)? Would an indemnity provider like MDU have specialised cover for this sort of thing or?

 I have been in a long term relationship throughout med school with my partner who I am now culturally/ traditionally married to. We just haven’t done a religious / white wedding yet . We were planning on doing this April 2025
 I have just found out I am pregnant. This was not planned and is coming as a total shock/surprise . Yes we did use contraception but as I have learnt these can also fail My husband is very supportive and I know he will be a great dad
 I am just very anxious about it all. I am wondering if starting f1 whilst pregnant is a good idea . I am a graduate student so having a baby was definitely a plan in the near future . Initially taking a year out after F1 or F2
 I am also worried on the financial strain this will put on my husband as by the time I am due I will not be entitled to the nhs maternity pay 
 I am just wondering if I should just postpone f1 to next year altogether? My due date at the moment is late December/ early Jan so I could technically finish the first rotation 
 Fy1 is already hard enough and I’m just worried I will not be able to cope.

 Please help us understand your views and experiences in relation to the role of Physician Associates (PAs) in general practice settings by completing our survey by Fri 10th May.
 The survey has been developed by the RCGP, following direction from RCGP Council, but is being conducted independently by Research by Design, an independent research agency.
 Your response will help us to understand more about how PAs are currently working in general practice as well as GP views on the benefits and challenges associated with this. We are also seeking your input on what framework and parameters should be in place to ensure that PAs working in general practice can do so safely and effectively, and what guidance is needed from RCGP.
 I know you're all really busy, but the survey should only take 20–25 minutes to complete, and is really important, so please do take part if you can. We are keen to hear from as many members as possible to ensure we can gain a good understanding of views across the UK.

 Probably going to complete training and leave the profession because I’ve realised that nothing will ever change no matter how hard I work and whatever I do to try to make the system better will just cause push back on me - so there’s no point. Have learnt this the hard way every year so far as a doctor - nobody wants improvement they only want to perpetuate the status quo and crush any challenge to authority or even open discussion. 
 The NHS can have its way and just employ under qualified robots to do it’s willing as per the way of the world these days. Maybe outsource healthcare to a call centre in India? Robot consultations as is the way in the USA. 
 Anyway - does anyone actually know a tradesperson earning £50-60k/y? I’d rather cut my losses and go back to college despite having postgrad degrees on top of medical training. 
 Has anyone successfully started a business like aesthetics or even non medical and made it succeed? 
 Is there any hope at all for the profession because I’m not hearing anything positive at all and it feels very much like the government don’t want or need doctors and in the UK the government IS the NHS. And the overseas market for UK doctors is saturated. 
 Do any senior doctors actually want to change the system? And do they understand what your junior ‘colleagues’ are going through (ie not just robots to do what you tell them but also thinking and intelligent humans wish to contribute)?

 Should I be feeling this insecure so close to the end? 
 Still find myself making silly mistakes, nothing untoward happening to the patients but still dumb mistakes/oversights that I catch later and spend the day ruminating about. 
 I get good feedback from juniors and consultants but I don’t think they tend to notice what I’m up to being a senior trainee.

 At this point, I'd like to point out I am very aware of what I'm asking for when I request a blood transfusion and I do have a genuine appreciation for the risks involved and for the potential for catastrophic mishaps.
 However, I've seen multiple occasions where samples have been rejected (often at the disservice of the patient) for extremely rigid rules that are completely inflexible. This leads to repeated stabs which are unpleasant for the patient or, at its worst, a delay in transfusion of cross matched blood. 
 What are your feelings on the threshold for rejecting G&S samples?

In the BMA MAP scope, it says teaching is not to happen unless it falls within the safe parameters of working for MAPS. Does this mean things both within the green and orange boxes?
 For example, in psych, the green for MAPS is physical healthcare related only. So does this mean PA can teach related to performing a physical exam, but shouldn’t be teaching things like MSE/History taking? 
 Likewise, O&G, orange box is refit or replace vaginal pessaries. Can they be teaching doctors how to do so?
 Has anyone been asked to arrange teaching programmes involving PA as educators and if so how have you organised this so it’s appropriate?

The case that you are reflecting on is [insert scenario] and the learning points that you want to take away are [insert learning points]. The reflective piece should be between 500-1000 words and should be based on the Gibbs reflective cycle. Keep a professional tone but inject some evidence of empathy throughout the text” 
 I’ve been getting middling results with this and was wondering if anyone has any pointers on how to improve the prompt? 
 Edit: totally on board with the responses about 500-1000 words being way too long. My initial plan was to just pad it with so much stuff nobody would bother reading it to be honest!

 Is it feasible that we both do this if we have a 5 year old child? And we will all be moving to the UK mid-July before FY2 starts. 
 I’m concerned regarding our schedule and it its feasible to manage being hands-on with our son or if it would be very busy and if its advisable I apply to GP training once my husband is done with FY2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was assigned a community placement in psychiatry for my GP training. When I tried to get a fob to access the car park, I was told that because I'm only there for 4 months, I'm not eligible for a fob. When I asked the admin team where I was supposed to park, they told me to park on the roads nearby. The placement is in quite a deprived area, and I didn't feel comfortable parking on the roads a few minutes walk away. So I parked in the patients' car park a few times, and was issued a £100 fine.
 I ended up telling the consultant that I'm under about the whole situation, and he was very indignant about it. Sent an email to the admin team straightaway and I got a car park fob the next day. In hindsight, should have told the consultant about it a lot sooner.
 Just really nice to have your consultant stick up for you!

 However the simplest service step of just saying, 'the wait will be about 30 minutes, you need to wait for the doctor', or even 'the wait could be 4 hours because we only have 1 ### but you need to be here in case we get you in earlier'. 
 People just want to know something, so they can relax. But you're forced to awkwardly approach staff milling about and ask, which makes you look impatient. When you just want some idea of what's going on.

I was wondering what are my options to continue a career in neuroscience and get lab accredited if I don’t happen to get into the STP? I understand there’s always other masters courses without the clinical training aspect but I really want a career in the NHS and to work in healthcare. Also just fyi my Bsc is not an IBMS accredited degree so I don’t have any certification to work in a lab once I graduate. I feel like the STP is my best chance at kickstarting my career so I need to have a backup if it doesn’t work out this year. Please help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. 
 A benign mass was found in my breast a few months ago but I’m really nervous as I feel like I’m being pushed toward surgery. 
 I’ve had appointments set for days I’ve informed the staff I can’t make, appointment times moved without consultation, and they want to make a 5cm incision on my breast (either around my nipple or near my armpit) but won’t tell me where they’re going to cut into me until after I’m under (I’m not a very big person that will be a significant portion of my breast). There’s been little to no explanation about surgery risks or even a conversation about doing a second ultrasound or resources I can access as a disabled person as I’ve been told for 2 weeks I shouldn’t use my left arm which is the side I use with my mobility aid. I’m not even sure if I’m going to be operated on by a plastic surgeon as I model and have body dysmorphia and I’m really scared of having complications and how this may affect my physical and mental health which are already not good (surgeon said that there would be no complication risks outside of the “usual surgery risks” (which were not explained), even with cutting around the nipple). 
 I’ve not had the best experience with the NHS so far (5 years trying to get mental health help, 3 years trying to get help for my FND since having to pay for a private neurology and MRI consult, which is part of the reasons I don’t have have savings as they’ve mostly been spent on trying to access healthcare) and I can’t tell if this is normal or other past experiences are clouding my judgement. I’m incredibly anxious about this whole thing as I don’t really have a support network outside of my care team. If anyone could share their own experiences with breast clinics in the UK I would appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (30sF) had a relationship for over 10 years with my ex (30sM) broke up 3 years ago.
 It ended badly. He took my home and my possessions. Cheated, was abusive. He sexually assaulted me. I didn't report it, so no official complaint is logged.
 He moved away. I hoped that was the end of it, and we could both start our separate lives.
 Last year, he moved back and into the hospital I worked in.
 I soon moved because I didn't want to be anywhere near him.
 He's contacted friends asking where I am.
 My relative with learning disabilities needed an appointment in my ex's part of the hospital. My relative's mother called to ask if he was there so they could avoid him. They said he would be, but not in the department my relative was going for his appointment.
 My relative was very fond of my ex, and when they suddenly disappeared, they couldn't understand where he had gone. He mourned and cried for months.
 My family were afraid they might meet him there and add to the confusion and be very upsetting for him, but they were reassured he'd be far enough away and chances low.
 Unfortunately, he saw my relative and approached him. Told him he could come visit him at the hospital whenever he wants. It was a lie and quite distressing for my family member.
 More recently, he had a patient who worked at the same place as my sister (work uniform very identifiable). He asked this patient if he knew my sister, and that when he found out he did, he asked the patient to say hello to her from him.
 My sister and my ex understandably are on very bad terms, and any contact is not wanted. She wants nothing to do with him.
 I don't know what his motive is for trying to get a patient to contact my sister like this.
 Can I or my family make a complaint? Would anything even happen? Could this help stop him continuing to contact my family using the hospital?
 Any help is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I attended my pre-op assessment, and also had a phone call offering me a date in a few weeks' time for my operation, which I gladly accepted. Shortly after the call I received a confirmation letter stating the date, time, ward etc.
 Near the top of the letter is a phone number to 'reschedule or cancel'. Apart from the general switchboard number, there is no other phone number in the letter. As the number is specifically to 'reschedule or cancel', it seems reasonable that if I don't contact them it means I want to keep the appointment. However, on the last page of the letter there's a checklist of things to do before my operation, one of which is to confirm the appointment date.
 I wasn't sure what to do, so I figured I'd ring the number anyway just to make an enquiry. But after trying multiple times in the past week, I haven't been able to get through to anyone.
 So my question is, should I persist in trying to contact someone, or am I safe to assume my operation is going to happen? Also, as my appointment is now in less than two weeks, what if I'm unable to get a response in time? Is there a possibility of my operation being cancelled?
 I appreciate this is a silly/paranoid question, but I've been through so many headaches and so much bureaucracy to get to this point that I'm terrified of doing something (or not doing something) that would jeopardise my operation.
 Further adding to my anxiety is my NHS app showing no upcoming appointments despite me having been removed from the waiting list (is this an indication that the appointment needs to be confirmed?).
 Thanks in advance, and apologies if I sound a little nutty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, for a few years I've been having recurring abdominal pain, which seems to be chronic gastritis as I have all the symptoms.
 I first brought this up to my GP in 2022, which resulted in me taking prescribed omeprazole for 3 months. After no improvement, I was booked in for some blood tests to get some more insight. I was diagnosed with anemia and given iron supplements to take for some time, but still no answer as to what's causing my stomach pain.
 Once again there was no improvement, so I went to the GP again. This time I given a stool sample kit to detect h pylori, but apparently the results were "inconclusive." I went in for some more blood tests, and still no answer for my stomach pain.
 This month, I went to the GP once again, this time outright asking for a referral/endoscopy. I expressed my frustrations, I explained as to why I think I have gastritis, autoimmune gastritis that this, as it is characterised by a lack of h pylori and anemia is a common symptom. The GP once again, completely blew me off, and gave me yet another stool sample kit which came back inconclusive and booked me in for yet another blood test.
 This has been going on for years and I'm frankly sick of it. I want a diagnosis and I want the proper treatment. I literally have every single marker of autoimmune gastritis. My abdominal pain is unbearable and all I get are iron supplements. What can I do???

I recently downloaded the NHS app & it shows which medication I am on, but it's not showing my medical condition! Which I've had since birth, it's not showing on the NHS app! I've been at my current doctors for 5 years & they're aware of my medical history. It says medical Condition 0. 
 I asked my doctors & they asked me to put it in writing which I did. Does anyone know how long it will take to get my full medical history from birth if possible? Because I was really sick as a child. My mum told me had different medical issues which I later found out I didn't. thank you.
 Thank you to everyone. I have my medical records now. 163 pages.

 It seems GP across the country is in a dire situation, but I have been told it is "better" in London. 
 For fully qualified GP's who are and have been working in London...
 How is it? 
 Is it sustainable? 
 Are there more "opportunities", private or otherwise? 
 Do you get paid (alot) more in London? 
 Are there more partnership opportunities? How about getting into other industries such as branching into health tech / pharma? 
 Or perhaps going into more public health / regulation / policy? 
 For those outside of London, is it as bad as the press says it is? GPs going to food banks, or going to 
 I think the recent issues in GP have been making me strongly consider whether to remain in training or leave to enter a different speciality. 
 I figured getting some objective truth / advice from fellow GPs on here would be helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all am a bit stuck with delays getting onto the performers list and having a nightmare with PCSE, would appreciate some advice about how I can try and get it sorted asap. I’m UK trained and CCT’d in Feb 2024. I hadn’t been told re: being on the PL as a registrar so tried to apply as qualified since mid January. Initially PCSE website was down so couldn’t do it, then my account got frozen and unusable, it took 6 weeks of emails and phone calls for them to sort. I finally got application put through and have been waiting another few weeks since. All this while, I managed to get a job on OOH bank contract but am being told I’m not allowed to take any work with them until on PL. I’m also concerned if this drags on further they’ll terminate my contract. I engaged BMA before but hasn’t seemed to help. I’m now almost 3 months post CCT and it’s causing me loss of income- I’ve drawn on savings for mortgage etc but the whole thing has impacted my finances and I’m pretty angry. Any help/advice much appreciated sorry if this comes across as ranty!

I am currently in Japan and have been here for the past 3 months, absolutely love the people and the culture, and planning to travel for least 12 months. I don’t want to keep coming back to uk and locuming for a couple of weeks and heading out again. Then it hit me , why not work remotely using a VPN . There must be way right, I mean we are living in 2024 not 1980, the world is so connected now. I heard that indemnity can be a headache ? I don’t understand why tho. What’s the difference between speaking to a patient in Japan as opposed to in my living room , if makes no sense to me. Has anyone done this ? Would really like to hear your thoughts. Thanks all 🙏

 I apologise for asking such a blunt question, but I’ve always wondered about this and wondered if anyone can inform me. 
 I always think about the paramedic who informed me that my Mum had passed away, many years ago. She died in a very upsetting and traumatic way, and from what I understand, the visual would have been really upsetting. I did not see her. 
 I always think of him and I wonder what kind of support he would have been given. Is there an official process? Is there mandatory counselling given after incidents like this? 
 Thank you in advance, and apologies for the morbid question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a medical exemption card. When I went to get a prescription earlier, they said ‘and you have a pre-paid certificate right?’ And I said ‘no I have a medical exemption’ and they looked puzzled and said they have me down as pre-paid certificate. I showed my card, they then entered the correct type and all was fine. 
 What has now worried me is I’ve collected prescriptions a couple of times from here previously, one last week and one in January. I’m pretty sure I showed my card then or said I had a medical exemption. Any chance they wrote down the wrong type at one point and now that’s stored on my file? Could I get penalised by the NHS BSA if it looks like l’ve claimed on this when I haven’t? Maybe they’d see if I have a medical exemption and it’d be ok, but not sure how their checking system works. 
 I will go into the pharmacy tomorrow just to check with them, but thought I’d ask on here as it’s causing a little anxiety. Thank you

 Accepted on upcoming Aug entry to GPST. I already have my locality.
 I'm looking to get a mortgage. The broker says they need a contract prior to AIP/offer. Does anyone have past experience with when we would receive an offer (I'd imagine it might be very late) or any other advice regarding this.
 I would imagine even the specialist brokers for doctors would require a contract.
 Thank you

 When you speak to the patient, a good proportion won’t have actually seen a doctor: - Some of them went to their practice nurse for a routine checkup - Some of them went to one of the PA or ACPs - Some of them called up their GP and couldn’t get past the “go to A&E if you think it’s an emergency”
 Anyone else noticed this/got any thoughts? You never actually went to your GP, but it all gets lumped together as “why has their GP sent them in for THAT?!?!l 
 (Obviously goes without saying that shit and/or GPs exist, and everyone’s guilty of an embarrassing referral)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Wanted to get thoughts from people.
 I'm entering GP training in August. I really wanted an A&E rotation as I want to work in A&E occasionally as a GP. I'm interested in managing minor injuries, suturing, procedures etc. I know a lot of this is done by non doctors but I wanted to build up experience so I can do a lot of OOH work as a GP. However, I didn't get my chosen ED rotation as there were only 3 to choose from...
 Does this limit my ability once I'm qualified if I wanted to spend a decent amount of time in ED as a GP?

I have seen that the fill rate for GP training for the previous years was always less than 100%. Does that mean that there are always unoccupied posts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new oral vaccine for cholera has received prequalification by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 April. The inactivated oral vaccine Euvichol-S has a similar efficacy to existing vaccines but a simplified formulation, allowing opportunities to rapidly increase production capacity. 
“The new vaccine is the third product of the same family of vaccines we have for cholera in our WHO prequalification list,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, Director of the WHO Department for Regulation and Prequalification. “The new prequalification is hoped to enable a rapid increase in production and supply which many communities battling with cholera outbreaks urgently need.”
WHO prequalification list already includes Euvichol and Euvichol-Plus inactivated oral cholera vaccines produced by EuBiologicals Co., Ltd, Republic of South Korea, which also produces the new vaccine Euvichol-S.  
Vaccines provide the fastest intervention to prevent, limit and control cholera outbreaks but supplies have been at the lowest point amidst countries facing dire shortcomings in other areas of cholera prevention and management such as safe water, hygiene and sanitation.  
There were 473 000 cholera cases reported to WHO in 2022 -- double the number from 2021. Further increase of cases by 700 000 was estimated for 2023. Currently, 23 countries are reporting cholera outbreaks with most severe impacts seen in the Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.]]></summary>

 I got confused re-dosages, escalation policy and when to use what 
 Nice/BTS/GINA State different things and dosages : so my questions are 
 ​
 -Any simplified escalation policy including dosages involved? 
 -Maximal dose of steroid per day (GINA states 2000, BTS/NICE 1000) 
 -Maximal dose of LABA. It's officially 46 for Formoterol, but saw patients using more. 
 -What do you give if patient is on Fostair and reached 8 puffs a day (=maximal dose of Formoterol 46mcg) and you wish to increase his inhaled steroids 
 -role of muntelukast in this story 
 -role of anti histamins (as resp nurses gives it at times as well) 
 -would you give combined LABA+Steroid(e.g. fostair) and also reliever therapy as salbutamol of not well controlled on maximal dose?

If I try to open a PDF it's russian roulette whether or not my screen will hang, and don't even get me started on the arachaic Word referral doc system we still have going because that's another rant in itself...
 I looked at "My Computer" the other day and saw that the PC I use has 8GB RAM. My iPhone has 6GB of RAM and all I use that for is reddit and ignoring my emails, but I digress.
 I found this the other day. An 8GB RAM upgrade for the PC I'm using. This would double my RAM, quadrouple my productivity and probably cure the viral URTI of the patient sitting in front of me if it tried hard enough - and all for the low, low price of £16.94.
 So tell me, someone, anyone, please, why shouldn't I just purchase this and install it onto my practice PC? It would cost me less than a nice take-out dinner and serve me righteously for years to come!
 (PS: Do you think I would have to run this by the IT guy or do you think it's cool if I just open 'er up and giv'r? Srs answers only plz.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello GPs and supervisors, 
 I am currently GPST2 who is starting a placement at a UTC where there’s basically no GPs and obviously no GP trainers. It’s completely run by allied health care professionals. There’s a GP on-call remotely for advice and that’s all. 
 My question is: am I ok with working with no supervision? As per my understanding and the NHSE policy; GP trainees are to be supervised at all times when in GP practice. I don’t know if it’s the same with UTCs. 
 Advice and course of action appreciated.
