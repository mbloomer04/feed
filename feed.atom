        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rhiannon Smith, Content Designer for NHS.UK, explains how the NHS website team are making content about skin symptoms more inclusive.


NHS Digital design principles say: “Be inclusive: NHS services are for everyone. Make sure people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs can use your design.”


However, on the NHS website, skin symptoms are mostly described in terms of how they appear on white skin. There are very few examples of what skin problems and conditions look like on various skin tones.]]></summary>

The demand for service designers has grown rapidly in recent years, while the understanding of what service design is, has not. For many organisations, service design is simply ‘user experience’ with a new name.


Service design, and user-centred design, are mutually supportive ways of working to approach problems, to achieve the best possible outcomes.


For effective service design, organisations must understand the conditions required and be prepared to make changes.]]></summary>

One of the frequent challenges in my previous creative roles was explaining why we needed to bear in mind specific considerations for the audience that a commissioner had not always recognised.


Often, clients submitted a request for a video without a strategic purpose. We would rely on brand guidelines where they existed, but this still didn’t answer the central question of why we should create things a certain way.

In the decade since the NHS Spine was launched, digital health and care services have become significantly larger, much more complex and more central to NHS provision. The Spine platform provides critical healthcare infrastructure and we must modernise to keep up with the demands being placed on it.]]></summary>
