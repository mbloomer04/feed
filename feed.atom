        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James Higgott, Lead Product Manager for the NHS website, talks about how his team is using a comprehensive roadmap to help them focus on outcomes, not outputs.


We recently published an update to the roadmap for the NHS website (nhs.uk). This describes what we will (and won’t) do to meet user needs and organisational goals on the UK’s biggest health website.


Previously, the roadmap we used internally was more like a Gantt chart than a true roadmap. Each item had a start and an end date and a description of the output, not the outcome.


In March 2023, we made significant changes to how we created and presented the roadmap. This is how we did it.]]></summary>

NHS 75 is an incredibly proud moment for me and, I hope, for all the people who work so hard across the NHS and its wider ecosystem to provide care for patients up and down the country.


In the lead up to the NHS 75 celebrations, I have reflected on what has changed since NHS 70 and, particularly, about the evolution of the NHS App since its launch at the beginning of 2019.]]></summary>

I spend part of my week in a hospital setting and part as a locum in community pharmacies. The Summary Care Record application (SCRa) has always been an indispensable tool in this work, allowing quick and secure access to clinical information, but it can be tricky to access when moving between sites for locum clinicians like me.


In December 2022, I was approached by the Summary Care Record application team at NHS England to test out the National Care Records Services (NCRS), the successor to the SCRa. This is some of what I have found out.]]></summary>

It should be quick and simple for a patient to register with a GP surgery, but often it isn’t. Having worked in many GP surgeries, I’ve seen both patients and practice staff struggle with the process, leading to a poor experience for all. This can vary from patients being daunted when faced with dated, confusing and lengthy paper registration forms to busy practice staff having to find the time to deal with new registrations amongst all their other tasks.]]></summary>
