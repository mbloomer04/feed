Governments meeting in Geneva for the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly are in talks to advance these two efforts, which aim to boost the world’s ability to better able to prevent and respond to the threat of future pandemics.
 
WHO Member States agreed to continue to work during the World Health Assembly, which ends on 1 June, with the aim to:

finalize the package of amendments to the IHR (2005)
agree the timing, format and process to conclude the pandemic agreement.

 During today’s session, the WHA first considered agenda item 13.4 on the draft pandemic agreement. Delegates acknowledged the extensive work undertaken by the Member State-led Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), and the Bureau steering the work, since governments launched the process in December 2021 to develop the world’s first pandemic accord to prevent a repeat of the global health, economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Member States reiterated that the world needs a pandemic agreement built on the principles of equity, sovereignty, and prevention, preparedness and response, and to ensure future generations are safeguarded from the threat of inevitable future pandemics.
 
WHA delegates also considered agenda item 13.3, which laid out the work undertaken to negotiate the amendments to the International Health Regulations(2005) to build on lessons learned from the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
Member States stressed that agreement on updated and stronger International Health Regulations were essential for ensuring global health security.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mpox continues to affect people around the world. A new  framework released today by WHO will guide health authorities, communities and other stakeholders in preventing and controlling mpox outbreaks, eliminating human-to-human transmission of the disease, and reducing spillover of the virus from animals to humans.
Mpox is a viral illness caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). It can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick. The virus transmits from person to person through close, including sexual, contact. It also has animal reservoirs in east, central and west Africa, where spillovers from animals to humans can occasionally occur, sparking further outbreaks. 
There are two different clades of the virus: clade I and clade II. Clade I outbreaks are deadlier than clade II outbreaks. 
A major emergence of mpox linked to clade II began in 2017, and since 2022, has spread to all regions of the world. Between July 2022 and May 2023, the outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. While that outbreak has largely subsided, cases and deaths continue to be reported today, illustrating that low-level transmission continues around the world. 
Currently, there is also a  major outbreak of clade I virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where cases have been on the rise for decades. Since the beginning of the year, over 6500 cases and 345 deaths have been reported in the DRC. Almost half of these are among children under the age of 15 years.
The Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox (2024–2027) provides a roadmap for health authorities, communities, and stakeholders worldwide to control mpox outbreaks in every context, advance mpox research and access to countermeasures, and to minimize zoonotic transmission.]]></summary>

The pandemic wiped out nearly a decade of progress in improving life expectancy within just two years. Between 2019 and 2021, global life expectancy dropped by 1.8 years to 71.4 years (back to the level of 2012). Similarly, global healthy life expectancy dropped by 1.5 years to 61.9 years in 2021 (back to the level of 2012).
The 2024 report also highlights how the effects have been felt unequally across the world. The WHO regions for the Americas and South-East Asia were hit hardest, with life expectancy dropping by approximately 3 years and heal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of the World Health Assembly 77, Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have signed Core Contribution Agreement to support the implementation of the extended 13th WHO Programme of Work.
The agreement entails a contribution of $4 million from the State of Qatar to WHO, through QFFD, aimed at enhancing the Organization's efforts in addressing global health challenges. This partnership underscores the State of Qatar and QFFD's unwavering commitment to improving health outcomes and promoting sustainable development goals worldwide.
"Our partnership with WHO is a testament to our dedication to leaving no one behind in the pursuit of health equity worldwide. By supporting WHO, we aim to empower communities, enhance healthcare access, and contribute to a healthier future for all." Said Mr Sultan Ahmed Al-Aseeri, Acting Director-General of QFFD.
“Flexible funds are critical for WHO’s life-saving work. With thanks to long-standing partners like the Qatar Fund for Development, WHO can use these funds to swiftly respond to global health needs as they arise. I am grateful to the State of Qatar for their support and for allowing us the flexibility we need to carry out our mission and mandate,‘’ said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The extended 13th WHO Programme of Work (GWP13) focuses on a comprehensive approach to health, addressing communicable and non-communicable diseases, strengthening health systems, and promoting health through the life course. This collaboration will particularly emphasize supporting countries in crisis and post-crisis contexts, aligning with the State of Qatar and QFFD's mission to provide crucial aid where it is needed most.
As the world continues to navigate complex health challenges, the partnership between QFFD and WHO represents a beacon of hope and a model for international cooperation in the realm of global health. This agreement is a significant step towards achieving the shared goal of a healthier, more resilient world.]]></summary>
